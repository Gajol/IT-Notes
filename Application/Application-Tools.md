ZenUML was born from a Finance project and is widely used in Bank, FinTech, Telecom, and Retail companies. From day one, we built ZenUML in a way that no data is sent to our server for rendering including image-export. No personal data is stored, transmitted, or otherwise processed by ZenUML‚Äôs server.

- [Mermaid Syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) : Mermaid is a syntax similar to Markdown where you can use text to describe and automatically generate diagrams. With Mermaid‚Äôs Markdown-inspired syntax, you can generate flow charts, UML diagrams, pie charts, Gantt charts, and more.  Mermaid‚Äôs syntax is similar to Graphviz DOT and PlantUML, both of which can be inserted into diagrams.net to create diagrams from a text description.
