Infrastructure as Code Direction:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Automation:
Scripting enables Automation: Installation and Configuration should be scripted, with scripts being managed in version control systems (Gitlab).  Scripting also enables:
- usage of variables for supporting various environments
- script goals: scripts should be idempotent (allowing re-execution producing the same results)

# Project Management
data driven decision making - estimates are based on what data...[USA 2019 - Evidence-Based Policy Making Act of 2018](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf)


 - Investments and projects in development are evaluated to determine the applicability

- mark data - e.g., use Schema.org
- index data - use Solr
- search/discover -
