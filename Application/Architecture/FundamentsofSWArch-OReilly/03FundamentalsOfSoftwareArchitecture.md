# Part II Architecture Styles

architecture style: the overarching structure of:
- how the user interface and backend source code are organized
- how that source code interacts with a datastore

Architecture patterns: are lower-level design structures that help form specific solutions within an architecture style:
- how to achieve high scalability
- how to achieve high perforance within a set of operations or between sets of service
- how to achieve high *ibility


Architecture Styles :

Monolithic:
- Pipeline  
- Microkernel

Distributed:
- Service-Based
- Event Driven
- Space Based
- Orchestration Drive / Service Oriented
- Microservice
