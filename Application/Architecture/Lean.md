# Lean
Agile borrows from Lean.

[Lean Software Development Principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development)
1. Eliminate Waste
1. Amplify learning
1. Decide as late as possible
1. Deliver as fast as possible
1. Empower the team
1. Build integrity in
1. Optimize the whole


Lean software practices
1. seeing waste
1. value stream mapping
1. set-based development
1. pull-systems
1. queuing theory
1. motivation
1. measurements
1. test-driven development

5-Step Lean Approach
1. Specify the value
1. Identify the important set of values
1. Create a flow (create steps to maintain flow) [see Value Stream Mapping ISBN 978-0071828918 ](https://www.amazon.com/Value-Stream-Mapping-Organizational-Transformation/dp/0071828915/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=holub-20&linkId=041c2c201a755c41afdbea7615335726&language=en_US)
1. Establish a pull (customer's pull value from the next activity)
1. Seek Perfection. (Seek product perfection and make sure there is no waste)

# Lean - Some common practices
- Gemba Walk :  The Gema Walk was developed by Toyota, and is founded around the concept of *Power of Engaged Leadership*.  Gemba is Japanese and refers to the actual place.   The concept is that the inefficiencies are visible and can be discovered by walking around the places where value is created.   This is siimlar to Management by Walking Around (MBWA).

# Lean vs Agile Software Development
[reference](https://www.spaceo.ca/lean-vs-agile-software-development/)


|Area|Agile|Lean|
|--|--|--|
|Focus|Focus on discovering requirements and developing business solutions|Focus on optimizing the development time and resources, delivering only the product which meets the core demands of customers|
|Strengths|Response to change.  Adaptive planning, evolutionary development, fast delivery and continuous improvement.  Each phase of development (spring) is planned, implemented, tested and evaluated.|Remove the fluff.  Lean management is about reducing the risk factor and optimizing the process (eliminate waste).  A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) strategy.|
|Background|Alternative to bulking software development models (waterfall).  By the time product was released it was outdated.|Toyota 1950's - Maintaining a steady flow of development that improves products and services|
|Created|2001 - 17 developers met at Snowbird resort|1950's Toyota|
|Usability|Very dynamic, makes it easy to implement change at any stage|Not flexible, dynamic changes in the product is difficult|
|Principles|Prioritizes scope and value|Prioritizes the quality of product and speed of development|

## Similarities
- customer centric approach

# Software Frameworks - Built on Lean

# Tools

Flow - Value Stream Mapping
Flow - In order to optimize flow, you have to understand the flow of development in your own organization.   This is done using value stream mapping.
