The whole philosophy behind these newer quality approaches is that people shouldn't have to ask management for permission to do something that needs to be approved; authority should be vested in the people doing the work, to improve their own processes, to teach them how to measure them, to understand them and to improve them, and they should not have to ask for permission to improve their processes.   [ a flattening of the traditional hierarchical organization and a distribution of authority to the people who are best in the position to decide what should happen to improve these processes - the permission to not have to ask for permission ]

- Dr. Deming & Joe Juran
