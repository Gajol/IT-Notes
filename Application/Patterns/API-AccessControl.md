# Physical Access Control
[USA DHS - Access Control Technologies Handbook - 2015](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ACT-HB_0915-508.pdf)
This Access Control Technologies Handbook provides emergency responders, military and law
enforcement security managers, and other security professionals with a reference on personnel
and vehicle access control technologies, capabilities, and limitations. This handbook provides
introductory-level information on the technologies and components for physical access control,
as well as an overview of operating principles and applications. This handbook does not cover
logical access control.
- Logical Access Control: A properly designed and installed token-based access control system can be used to monitor
physical access, logical access (e.g., computer and network), employee time and attendance, as
well as a number of other functions tailored to meet an organization’s security and administrative
requirements. Token-based access control has been widely used for many years.
