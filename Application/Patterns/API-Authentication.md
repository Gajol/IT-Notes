The OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow (OBO) serves the use case where an application invokes a service/web API, which in turn needs to call another service/web API. The idea is to propagate the delegated user identity and permissions through the request chain.

2019 - Web API chains (On-Behalf-Of) is not supported by Azure AD B2C. â€“ Many architectures include a web API that needs to call another downstream web API, both secured by Azure AD B2C. This scenario is common in clients that have a web API back end, which in turn calls a another service. This chained web API scenario can be supported by using the OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Credential grant, otherwise known as the On-Behalf-Of flow. However, the On-Behalf-Of flow is not currently implemented in Azure AD B2C [ref](https://www.taithienbo.com/pass-users-identity-and-authorization-from-a-client-application-to-a-web-api-to-another-web-api-using-oauth-2-0-on-behalf-of-flow/)
