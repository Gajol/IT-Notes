1. Using the [Solr Cell](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika.html#uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika) framework built on [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) for ingesting binary files or structured files such as Office, Word, PDF, and other proprietary formats.

1. Uploading XML files by sending HTTP requests to the Solr server from any environment where such requests can be generated.

1. Writing a custom Java application to ingest data through Solr’s Java Client API (which is described in more detail in Client APIs). Using the Java API may be the best choice if you’re working with an application, such as a Content Management System (CMS), that offers a Java API.
