AOP  - Aspect Oriented Programming
https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-aop-tutorial
Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) compliments OOPs in the sense that it also provides modularity. But the key unit of modularity is aspect than class.

AOP breaks the program logic into distinct parts (called concerns). It is used to increase modularity by cross-cutting concerns.

A cross-cutting concern is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible, such as transaction management, authentication, logging, security etc.
