Pure function
: A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only has no side effects but also doesn’t rely on side effects from other code—for example, it doesn’t read global bindings whose value might change. A pure
function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value (and doesn’t do anything else). A call to such a function can be substituted by its return value without changing the
meaning of the code.

// for ... of ...
for (let char of "Hello") {
  console.log(char);
}
```
