# Software
- Software was invented to be “soft.” It was intended to be a way to easily change the behavior of machines. If we’d wanted the behavior of machines to be hard to change, we would have called it hardware. [ref: Clean Architecture]

Paradigms are ways of programming, relatively unrelated to languages
1. Structured Programming (replace jumps with if/then/else)
1. Object Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
1. Functional Programming (immutability - no assignment statement)

- use polymorphism as the mechanism to cross architectural boundaries;
- use functional programming to impose discipline on the location of and access to data;
- use structured programming as the algorithmic foundation of our modules.
