# Goal Statement
The Executive Branch will build and maintain more modern, secure, and resilient information technology (IT) to enhance mission delivery and productivity – driving value by increasing efficiencies of Government IT spending while potentially reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and enhancing citizen engagement and satisfaction with the services we provide.

## Goal Structure
1. Enhance Federal IT and Digital Services : Improve the quality and efficiency of critical citizen-facing services by
removing the barriers for rapidly adopting the best-in-class commercial
solutions to better meet the needs of citizens.

1. Reduce Cybersecurity Risks to the Federal Mission :
Mitigate the impact of risks to Federal agencies’ data, systems, and networks by implementing cutting edge cybersecurity capabilities.

1. Build a Modern IT Workforce :
Enable agencies to develop and empower an IT workforce with the skills to
achieve modernization goals and support up-to-date technology.

The challenge includes: limited accountability for achieving enterprise-wide outcomes that enhance IT service effectiveness and reduce cybersecurity risks; slow adoption of cutting edge commercial technologies due to onerous acquisition and authorization processes; and federal agencies employ patchwork network architectures and rely on legacy systems that are costly and difficult to secure and upgrade.

# The Opportunity
There are opportunities to:
- expand the use of modern commercial technologies that are effective, economical, and secure;
- reduce the impact of cybersecurity risks by safeguarding IT systems, sensitive data, and networks;
- leverage common solutions and innovative practices to improve efficiency, increase security, and ultimately meet citizens’ needs.
