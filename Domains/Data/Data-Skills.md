# Data Engineer
Think of a data engineer as an experienced software engineer who is highly skilled in building high-quality production-grade software systems with a specialization in building fast (and often distributed) data pipelines.

This individual will likely have significant expertise in one or more major programming languages (such as Java, Python, Scala, Ruby, or C++) and associated toolsets for software development such as build tools (Maven, Ant), unit testing frameworks, and various other libraries.

A data engineer will possess expertise in building systems that collect, store, and process data such as relational databases, NoSQL datastores, as well as the Hadoop stack, including HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, Pig, Hive, and Storm.
