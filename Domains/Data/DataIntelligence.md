- Build a Business Glossary: A common language to understand each otherA Business Glossary becomes your company’s semantic translator. Business users can find what they want instinctively and intuitively, without having to master tables, fields, column names and metadata — in effect, without having to become data scientists themselves. It improves transparency by offering a comprehensive view of all business terms along with their related data, metadata and data lineage.
- Establish Data Domain Models: Domain models give you a consistent and common representation of what is most important to the solution, deparment or company. Data domains offer a hugely powerful and transitive relationship with any other concept, data, report, algorithm, API or otherwise, managed within your Data Intelligence Graph
- Defining Policy Management & Reference Management: Data Governance is the practice of establishing and enforcing policies centered on data. We consider these the guide rails to proper data use and management that help ensure consistent adherence across the company.
