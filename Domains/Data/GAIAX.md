GAIA-X is a project for the development of an efficient and competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe, which is supported by representatives of business, science and administration from Germany and France, together with other European partners. The name of the project is derived from one of the first Greek deities, Gaia, who arose from chaos and who, in mythology, stands as the personified earth for the woman giving birth. The project was first presented to the general public at the Digital Summit 2019 in Dortmund (Germany) and has been continuously developed since then.[1]

The architecture of Gaia-X is based on the principle of decentralisation. Gaia-X is the result of a multitude of individual platforms that all follow a common standard – the Gaia-X standard. Together, we are developing a data infrastructure based on the values of openness, transparency, and trust. So, what emerges is not a cloud, but a networked system that links many cloud services providers together.

Innovation through digital sovereignty – that’s the goal of Gaia-X. We achieve this by establishing an ecosystem in which data is made available, collated and shared in a trustworthy environment. The users always retain __sovereignty__ over their data. So, what emerges is not a cloud, but a federated system that links many cloud services providers and users together.

Three architectural layers:
- The data ecosystem: The data ecosystem fosters networked spaces based on agreed rules. Data and service offerings can be shared transparently and across industry sectors. This promotes the creation of new intelligent services, which include e.g. artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things or Big Data applications.
- the infrastructure ecosystem: In the infrastructure ecosystem, the offerings from different providers are interoperable and interconnected. Providers can collaborate with each other to link their offerings, develop them further and expand them. This is how new user-friendly services are created.
- and the federation services: The Federation Services define the technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated Gaia-X ecosystem. They ensure the highest possible security requirements and privacy protection.


data spaces:  Data Spaces represent a data integration concept without a central storage. Thus, data remains at its source and is only shared when needed. A Data Space is formed by the entirety of its participants, which all follow the same rules.

Principles:
- Security by Design
- Privacy by Design
