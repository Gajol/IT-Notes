# LINDDUN methodology

The **LINDDUN** is short for its seven categories of privacy threats including linkability, recognition, non-repudiation, sensitivity, leakage of details, unconscionability and non-compliance. It is used as a privacy threat modeling methodology that supports analysts in systematically eliciting and mitigating privacy threats in software architectures.[[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_privacy_technologies#cite_note-19) Its main strength is its combination of methodological guidance and privacy knowledge support.[[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_privacy_technologies#cite_note-20)

LINDDUN ([LINDDUN.org](https://www.linddun.org/)) is a privacy threat modelling methodology that supports analysts in systematically eliciting and mitigating privacy threats in software architectures. LINDDUN adheres to the Privacy by Design paradigm 2 . It therefore primarily focuses on software systems under development in order to include privacy as early as possible in the development process.
