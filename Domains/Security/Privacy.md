# Privacy

Differential Privacy

anonymize vs deidentify

- deidentify: possible to re-identify through other datasets
- pseudonymization: allows trusted person (researcher, doctor, hospital, ..) to link back to person

data masking: alternation strategy: shuffling, encryption, character substitution, 

generalization: remove some data, data mapped to ranges

data swapping: permutation, shuffling: put data under different columns (DOB column is in another column)

synthetic data: modelled data, add noise (perturbation)

balance: privacy with utility (data accuracy)

Zero Knowledge Proof: Ability to reveal possession without revealing information.  Prover & Verifier.  Attributes on ZKP is completeness, soundness and zero-knowledge.
