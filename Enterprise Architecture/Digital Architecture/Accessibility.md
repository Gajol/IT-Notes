# Accessibility

Recognize exclusion.

Building accessibility into your design system basics[^LogRocket]:

- colour contrast
- typography: support a large, clear typeface
- image alt text
- iconography
- spacing
- elevation
- test system for accessibility: test above, test keyboard (tab order, no endless loops), screen reader

WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

1. Level A, which is the basic level of accessibility
2. Level AA, which includes everything in Level A and some extra requirements. This is the standard benchmark used in the industry
3. Level AAA, which is the highest level and includes all requirements from Level A and Level AA, plus even more accessibility features

### Canadian Digital Service

- [CDS](https://digital.canada.ca/) was created in response to 2013 & [2016 Auditor General](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201611_00_e_41829.html) reports that online services were not focused on the needs of Canadians, and services were complex and time consuming.  The reports used Standish Group's annual [Chaos reports](https://standishgroup.myshopify.com/) as reference.  The made-in-Canada design of CDS was based on a review of its international predecessors (especially in the United States and the United Kingdom) and[ a public engagement ](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/)[process ](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/)[across Canada](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/).
  - Note: Canada no longer has a Minister of Digital Government.  The last minister was Joyce Murray who's term ended in 2021.  The minister was responsible for Shared Services Canada (SSC).  SSC has now returned to the Minister of Public Services and Procurement.
  - [How CDS Started - 2017](https://digital.canada.ca/how-cds-started/full-report/) describes the case for digital government.  The article references the Organization for Ecoonomic Cooperation and Development (OECE)[^Digital]. The case references UK, USA and Australia focus on user-centric service innovation, rapid prototypiung, procurement reform and better use of data.  In Canada, Ontario was recognized as a pathfinder with [Ontario Digital Service](https://ontario.ca/digital).
- CDS mandate: CDS was launched in July 2017 with the mandate to change the way the government designs and delivers services. CDS was assigned to:
  - deliver services by partnering with departments and building prototypes of user-centric services
  - build the capacity of departments to apply modern service design and technological methods and tools
  - provide advice on key technology and service investment
- [TBS evaluation of CDS by Goss Gilroy Inc](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/reports/evaluation-canadian-digital-service.html).  Goss Gilroy did the [Phoenix Lessons Learned](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/reports/lessons-learned-transformation-pay-administration-initiative.html).  Results:
  - effective at agile digital delivery based on continuous improvements
  - less effective at meeting departments needs due to reliance on partners embracing change
  - product partnerships increased capacity, but post-partnership challenges remain
  - tension exist in implementation of user-centred methods
  - constraining factors: 
    - limited partnerships, legacy partner systems, lack of expertise and skills in departments
    - need for government-wide culture change, shifting processes and work to enable digital practics and service delivery
    - lack of clarity on CDS's mandate
  - 
- [Canada's Digital Ambition](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/canada-digital-ambition.html):  Recognizes CDS as developing tools following GOV.UK including GC Notify and GC Forms.

[^Digital]: Digital government is defined by OECD as *the rethinking of government policy, program and service delivery through digital enablers, as an integrated part of governments’ modernization strategies, to create public value. [Digital government] relies on and enables an ecosystem that connects government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, citizens’ associations and individuals to support the production of and access to data, services and content through interactions with the government.*
