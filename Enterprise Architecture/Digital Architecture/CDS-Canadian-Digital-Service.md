# Canadian Digital Service

## Mandate

- CDS was assigned to:
  - deliver services by partnering with departments and building prototypes of user-centric services
  - build the capacity of departments to apply modern service design and technological methods and tools
  - provide advice on key technology and service investment

## Creation

- [CDS](https://digital.canada.ca/) was created in response to 2013 & [2016 Auditor General](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201611_00_e_41829.html) reports that online services were not focused on the needs of Canadians, and services were complex and time consuming.  The reports used Standish Group's annual [Chaos reports](https://standishgroup.myshopify.com/) as reference.  The made-in-Canada design of CDS was based on a review of its international predecessors (especially in the United States and the United Kingdom) and[ a public engagement ](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/)[process ](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/)[across Canada](https://digital.canada.ca/beginning-the-conversation/).
  - :-1:: 2021: Canada no longer has a Minister of Digital Government[^Minister].  
  - :rocket: 2017: [How CDS Started - 2017](https://digital.canada.ca/how-cds-started/full-report/) describes the case for digital government.  The article references the Organization for Ecoonomic Cooperation and Development (OECE)[^Digital]. The case references UK, USA and Australia focus on user-centric service innovation, rapid prototypiung, procurement reform and better use of data.  In Canada, Ontario was recognized as a pathfinder with [Ontario Digital Service](https://ontario.ca/digital).
- CDS mandate: CDS was launched in July 2017 with the mandate to change the way the government designs and delivers services. 

## Organizing for Digital

During the summer of 2017, with consultation with Canadians the follow items were identified[^Creation]:

Focused Leadership:  Need central agency ownership.  Horizontal leadership to move beyond department silos.  Need for a dedicated champion. 

Evolving Leadership Roles:  CIO responsibilities have broadened and the mandate in untenable.  Trend is for a CDO position (Chief Data Office): Province of Ontario, City of Vancouver, ISED, National Film Board.

- CIO focused on technology functions that relate to back-office and cyber security
- CDO plays role in business transformation and the use of technology to achieve customer-facing goals

Revolution vs Evolution: Evolving slowly by design might be necessary for aspects of government that ensure safety and security of Canadians, other areas of government can move more nimbly. 

Working in Open: be open - blogs, social media, open code sharing. This is symbolically important.

Better services through data: Data is critical to improving service delivery.  Sharing data.  Transform conversation about the government's use of data.  

## Evaluation - 2021

- [TBS evaluation of CDS by Goss Gilroy Inc](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/reports/evaluation-canadian-digital-service.html).  Goss Gilroy did the [Phoenix Lessons Learned](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/reports/lessons-learned-transformation-pay-administration-initiative.html).  Results:
  - effective at agile digital delivery based on continuous improvements
  - less effective at meeting departments needs due to reliance on partners embracing change
  - product partnerships increased capacity, but post-partnership challenges remain
  - tension exist in implementation of user-centred methods
  - constraining factors: 
    - limited partnerships, legacy partner systems, lack of expertise and skills in departments
    - need for government-wide culture change, shifting processes and work to enable digital practics and service delivery
    - lack of clarity on CDS's mandate
- [Canada's Digital Ambition](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/canada-digital-ambition.html):  Recognizes CDS as developing tools following GOV.UK including GC Notify and GC Forms.
