# CSIS 

## Restrictions

As with all national security and intelligence agencies, CSIS operates within certain legal constraints and restrictions when it comes to investigating Canadian citizens. Some of the key restrictions include:

- CSIS is required to obtain a warrant from the Federal Court to conduct intrusive investigative activities against Canadian citizens. This includes activities like phone and computer tapping, physical surveillance, and accessing private records.
- CSIS must have reasonable grounds to believe that a Canadian citizen is engaging in activities that constitute a threat to national security before it can open an investigation.
- CSIS must be transparent and report to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness on all investigations involving Canadian citizens.

The purpose of these restrictions is to ensure that CSIS operates within the bounds of Canadian law and respect for civil liberties. It also serves as a check on the agency's power to ensure that it does not overstep its mandate.

Of course, there have been instances in the past where CSIS has been accused of overstepping its authority in its investigations of Canadian citizens. However, the agency has also taken steps to improve its accountability and transparency in recent years.



## Role

The role of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) is to protect Canada and Canadians from a range of threats, including terrorism, espionage, foreign interference, and organized crime.

CSIS is responsible for gathering, analyzing, and reporting intelligence on national security threats. This includes monitoring activities of individuals and groups that may pose a threat to Canada's security, and investigating suspected threats.

In addition to intelligence gathering, CSIS also works to prevent threats from materializing by sharing information and intelligence with law enforcement agencies, government departments, and international partners.

Ultimately, the role of CSIS is to ensure that Canada is safe and secure from a wide range of national security threats, while also respecting individual rights and freedoms as enshrined in Canadian law.

Some key functions of CSIS include:

- Conducting intelligence gathering and analysis
- Identifying, investigating, and reporting on national security threats
- Providing advice and assistance to government departments on national security issues
- Collaborating with other national and international security agencies to share intelligence and coordinate efforts
- Disrupting threats before they can materialize
