# Strategy - General

## General

I am writing a digital strategy which is the approach to address the digital and technology challenges our department is facing.

That's very exciting! I think a digital strategy is crucial for organizations of all types to remain competitive and relevant in the modern era. It's great that you're leading this effort within your department. 

Broader challenges; we have old technology, we are risk-averse to trying new technologies, we are unable to attract people due to the restrictive process-heavy processes using outdated technology.

That's a lot to tackle, and it's a very common problem in many organizations. It can be especially difficult for organizations with security requirements to adopt new technologies, due to the scrutiny that is often applied. I think it's really important to take a holistic approach when developing a digital strategy, because otherwise it can be too easy to fall into the trap of focusing solely on the technology itself. It sounds like your department also has some people-related challenges that need to be addressed as part of the digital strategy. 

This is a really important insight. It's clear that any digital strategy for your department must be **mindful** of the existing culture and leadership dynamics. In my opinion, if you're able to address the cultural challenges alongside the technology challenges, then you'll have a much more impactful digital strategy. 

Top-down structures can create an environment where people don't feel like they have a voice or that their input matters. It can also make it difficult for people to experiment with new technologies and processes. It sounds like your digital strategy should prioritize empowering people within the organization, in addition to addressing technology and process issues.

In your opinion, does the current leadership team have the capacity to drive this change? Or will you need to look at new leadership structures and skills?

They have the capacity, they can likley develop the skills, but I am unsure they have the motivation as there is no sense of urgency.

It can be a real challenge to create a sense of urgency in a command-and-control culture. People may be reluctant to change if they don't feel like it's truly necessary. And, without a sense of urgency, it can be easy for people to drag their feet and resist change. How do you plan to create a sense of urgency and get people excited about the digital strategy?

One approach would be to emphasize the benefits of the changes, rather than just focusing on the need for change. People are more likely to engage with change if they understand how it will help them and make their lives easier. Can you give people a clear vision of how the changes will improve their work experience and create a better work environment? It might also be worth consid**ering small, incremental changes to start building momentum and creating quick wins that show people the benefits of change**. This can help create a sense of momentum and make people more open to future changes.

## Mission

Please write the mission for a department, named Public Safety, who is at the forefront of Canada's national security system. Our role is to investigate activities suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada and to report on these to the Government of Canada. We may also take measures to reduce threats to the security of Canada in accordance with well-defined legal requirements and Ministerial Direction.

The Digital Strategy will include four pillars, digital service, digital workforce, digital workplace and digital foundation. 

### Answer

Our mission is to protect Canada and its citizens through four pillars of digital strategy: digital service, digital workforce, digital workplace and digital foundation. We will work tirelessly to ensure that these pillars are realized, and that our department is always operating with the highest standards of transparency, accountability and respect for the rule of law

## Drivers

Can you describe of a HUMINT intelligence department.

Sure thing. HUMINT stands for "human intelligence," which is a type of intelligence that is collected by using human sources, such as undercover agents or informants. HUMINT departments typically focus on gathering information about individuals or organizations that can't be gathered through other means, such as open-source research or signals intelligence. HUMINT departments can be found within government agencies, military organizations, and even some private sector companies. The work of a HUMINT department is often very sensitive and requires a high degree of confidentiality and security. Does that give you a good overview?

What makes their work challenging?

There are several factors that make the work of a HUMINT department challenging. One is the inherent risk of using human sources, who may be unreliable or may have agendas that don't align with the department's goals. Another challenge is the need for highly-trained, skilled analysts who can interpret and make sense of the information gathered by HUMINT sources. Analysts need to be able to piece together information from multiple sources, understand cultural context, and draw connections that may not be immediately obvious. Additionally, operating in the shadows can be stressful and mentally demanding for HUMINT personnel.

From a digital perspective what are the challenges?

When it comes to the digital aspect of HUMINT, there are a number of unique challenges. One is the ever-evolving landscape of technology, which can make it difficult to keep up with the latest tools and techniques used by potential adversaries. Another challenge is the sheer volume of data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and acted upon. The digital footprint of individuals and organizations is constantly growing, which means HUMINT departments need to have robust tools and processes in place to deal with the constant influx of data. Finally, there is the issue of cybersecurity.

## Pillars

A pillar in a strategy refers to a key area of focus or a priority area for action. Pillars typically represent the main objectives or goals of a strategy, and they are used to break down the overall strategy into more specific and manageable components. In this way, pillars can help to ensure that a strategy is implemented in a focused and coordinated manner. For example, in the context of a digital strategy, the pillars might include areas such as infrastructure, security, talent, and innovation.

- infrastructure, security, talent, and innovation.

### Digital Literacy

Some important digital literacy skills include:

- Basic computer skills such as using a browser, operating system, and productivity software (e.g. Microsoft Office)
- Basic information management skills such as searching the web, organizing information, and evaluating information sources
- Basic data literacy skills such as using spreadsheets and analyzing data
- Communication and collaboration skills such as using email and videoconferencing tools
- Digital security skills such as password management and protecting personal information online
- Critical thinking skills such as evaluating digital media and identifying misinformation

# Value

create value, improve efficiency, and better serve the mission. For a HUMINT department, this might mean looking at how to improve data collection and analysis, or how to better share intelligence across departments. In the end, the goal of both strategies would be to create more value for the government and the people it serves.

While a HUMINT department might not produce anything physical, it does provide value through the collection and analysis of intelligence, which can be considered intangible assets. The expertise and skills of the analysts in the department would also be considered intangible assets. In a way, a HUMINT department is part of the intangible economy because it produces value through non-physical assets. 

# Innovation

The pace of technological innovation is having a profound impact on society and governments. Technologies like social media, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing are changing how we communicate, make decisions, and organize society. In many ways, governments are struggling to keep up with these changes. They're grappling with issues like privacy, data security, and the role of technology in elections. On the plus side, these technologies are also creating new opportunities for governments to be more efficient, responsive, and transparent.

## Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often touted for their anonymity and decentralization, but these same features can also make them attractive to terrorists and other criminals. Terrorist groups can use cryptocurrencies to raise funds anonymously and without relying on traditional financial institutions that might be subject to government regulation or oversight. In addition, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to track and seize terrorist assets. There have been some cases of terrorist groups using cryptocurrencies to fund their activities, but it's still a relatively new and evolving area.

## socio-economic changes

One is the rise of the gig economy, with more people working as freelancers or in temporary or contract positions. This has led to a shift in the way people think about work and career, and has created new challenges for governments and organizations in terms of providing benefits and protections for these workers. Another significant change is the increasing cost of living, particularly for housing, healthcare, and education. These rising costs are putting pressure on people's budgets and are contributing to rising levels of debt and financial insecurity.

- gig economy
- work from home
- rising costs, housing, healthcare, education
- decreasing disposable income, discretionary income

## Political Stage Changes

Firstly, there is a growing desire for change among the electorate. Many people are frustrated with the status quo and are looking for new solutions to the problems they face. Secondly, there has been a lot of infighting within political parties, which is making it difficult for them to present a unified front and put forward a coherent message. Thirdly, there is a growing distrust of traditional political institutions and a desire for more grassroots-led approaches. Finally, new technologies and platforms have changed the way politics is communicated and debated. All of these factors are having a significant impact on the political landscape.

- want change from status quo
- new solutions to problems
- infighting in political parties
- distrust of political institutions
- tech has changed how politics is communicated (populist leader - twitter, influence - not based on polices and platform)

One of the most significant is the shift away from the traditional nation-state as the primary actor in global politics. We're seeing the rise of non-state actors, such as NGOs and multinational corporations, who are increasingly shaping global politics. Another major change is the increasing interconnectedness of the world, which is leading to a more globalized civil society and a greater focus on issues like human rights and environmental protection. There's also been a move towards more democratic forms of governance, with more countries moving towards democracy and away from authoritarianism.

- interconnectedness of the world - civilized word
- rise of non-state actors (NGO, multinational companies) - sharing global politics
- move to democratic forms of government

## National Security Threat Changes

Firstly, there has been a shift towards non-traditional threats, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation campaigns, and the rise of violent non-state actors. This has meant that the HUMINT community has had to shift their focus away from the traditional state-based intelligence targets and towards these new non-traditional threats. Secondly, the HUMINT community has had to adapt to the increasing digitization of society, which has both provided new opportunities for intelligence gathering but also made it more difficult to maintain the secrecy and security of operations.

- cyber attacks
- disinformation campaigns
- violent non-state actors (Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, criminal organizations like drug cartels, and insurgent groups like Boko Haram.)
  - These groups are often able to operate beyond the reach of traditional nation-states, and they can pose significant threats to national security. For example, terrorist organizations can use social media and other digital platforms to spread propaganda and radicalize individuals, while criminal organizations can exploit the anonymity of the internet to engage in illicit activities like human trafficking and money laundering.
  - Hezbollah is one of the most well-known non-state actors, and they're considered to be a significant threat to national security by many governments. Hezbollah is a militant group based in Lebanon that was originally formed in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. They're considered to be a terrorist organization by many Western countries, and they're accused of engaging in a range of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and kidnapping. They're also involved in the civil war in Syria, where they're fighting alongside the Syrian government.

## Critical Defense Cyber Defense

There are several approaches to cyber defense that are used for critical infrastructure. One is physical security, which includes things like fences and gates around facilities, security guards, and video surveillance. Another approach is network security, which involves things like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. Finally, there is personnel security, which includes things like background checks, training, and awareness campaigns. But despite all these measures, critical infrastructure remains vulnerable to sophisticated and determined attackers. Do you want to know about some specific cyberattacks that have occurred despite these protections?

## China, IC

China is a major concern for Western intelligence communities, both because of its growing cyber capabilities and because of its perceived hostile intentions towards Western countries. China has invested heavily in developing its cyber capabilities, and it has been accused of conducting large-scale cyber espionage operations against Western governments, corporations, and universities. There is also concern that China could use its cyber capabilities to disrupt critical infrastructure or to interfere in elections. Are you interested in hearing more about the specific threat posed by Chinese cyber capabilities?

- hostile institutions towards western countries
- developed cyber leadership
- large scale cyber attacks
- interfere elections or critical infrastructure

Reasons

- China sees the United States as its primary rival, and it believes that the U.S. is trying to contain its rise as a global power.
- China believes that Western countries, particularly the United States, are hypocritical in their criticism of China's human rights record. 
- China believes that Western countries are trying to sabotage its economic development through trade restrictions and other measures.
- China believes that Western countries are trying to undermine its political stability by supporting separatist movements within China, such as in Hong Kong and Tibet.

"As the world faces rapid changes in the political and economic spheres, the intelligence community must adapt to these developments through the use of technology. New approaches are needed to keep pace with the evolving global landscape." In other words, HUMINT (human intelligence) is no longer sufficient on its own, and technological innovations such as big data analytics are needed to better understand and navigate the rapidly shifting geopolitical climate. 

> navigate the rapidly shifting geopolitical climate

"The changing geopolitical stage is increasingly influenced by the rise of China. In this context, the intelligence community must adapt to the new geopolitical reality in which China plays a major role. New technologies, such as big data analytics, are needed to keep up with the pace of change, especially as it relates to China's growing influence."

## OSINT

Digital investments that support online activity and open-source intelligence (OSINT) could include things like:

- Advanced data analytics tools
- Automated search tools
- Social media monitoring tools
- Secure communication channels
- Cloud-based data storage
- Collaboration software

These are just a few examples, but the specific needs of the organization would determine the exact investments made. Is there a particular digital investment that you're curious about?

For human intelligence (HUMINT) specifically, digital investments could include things like secure collaboration tools, advanced data analytics, and cloud-based data storage. In addition, training and upskilling programs that focus on areas like social engineering and interviewing skills could also be considered digital investments, since they're designed to help HUMINT professionals make better use of digital tools and data

- secure collaboration tools
- advanced data analytics
- cloud-based data storage
- training & upskilling (social engineering, interviewing skills, ...)

OSINT specifically, there are a few key technical competencies that are important for professionals to have. These include:

- The ability to use search engines and online databases effectively
- Understanding of data formats and standards
- Knowledge of metadata and other technical details about online content
- Proficiency in web scraping and data extraction tools
- Familiarity with social media platforms and how they can be used to collect intelligence
- Proficiency in programming languages like Python or R that can be used for data analysis and visualization

# Modernize Technology & Reduce Technical Debt

One strategy is to prioritize and sequence modernization efforts, focusing on the most critical systems first. Another strategy is to adopt agile development practices, which can help to break down large modernization projects into smaller, more manageable chunks. Additionally, organizations can consider re-hosting legacy systems in the cloud, which can help to reduce costs and improve scalability.

- prioritization
- focus on critical systems
- adopt agile practices 
- break down large projects into smaller and manageable chunks (ideally using agile)
- re-hosting: move to cloud, (cut costs and enable scaling)

## Agile

agile doesn't mean "no planning" or "no architecture." Instead, it simply means that the architecture and design of the system should be flexible enough to allow for small, incremental changes over time. Breaking down large projects into manageable pieces can be a part of the planning process, but it's not the only option. Another approach is to consider "epics" and "user stories," which can help to break down the large project into smaller chunks without having to completely redo the architecture.

## Intelligence Cycle

The intelligence cycle is a six-stage process used by the intelligence community to collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence information. The six stages are: planning and direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and evaluation. Digital services can support each of these stages in different ways. For example, planning and direction can be supported by digital services that provide geospatial data, or data on social media trends. Collection can be supported by digital services that automate the collection of data from various sources. And so on for the other stages.

## Bilateral HUMINT

the main external partners for HUMINT are other countries that have strong bilateral relationships with the intelligence department in question. For example, the United States has a long-standing and well-known relationship with the United Kingdom when it comes to HUMINT. This relationship allows for the exchange of information and intelligence between the two countries, which can be very beneficial for both sides. There are also other countries that have similar relationships with the United States, and these relationships can be very valuable for intelligence gathering and analysis. Can I ask why you're interested in this topic?

## Courts & Trust

CSIS has worked to establish trust with the federal courts. One way is by being transparent about their methods and procedures. CSIS has published a number of documents that outline their policies and practices, which helps to build trust by showing that they are open and accountable. Another way is by working closely with the courts to ensure that their operations are in line with the law and that they are respecting the rights of individuals. For example, CSIS has established a robust oversight mechanism that includes both internal and external review bodies.

## Digital Native

This could refer to a program that identifies and nurtures employees who are already proficient in digital technologies and then supports them to share their knowledge and skills with others in the organization. This approach can help to speed up the adoption of digital tools and technologies within the organization, as it allows for knowledge to be disseminated more quickly. 

Framework:

- here would need to be a way to identify and recruit digital-native champions from across the organization. 
- there would need to be a structure for training and developing these champions so that they can effectively support others. 
- there would need to be a system for measuring the success of the program, such as tracking adoption rates and satisfaction levels. 
- there would need to be a way to ensure that the program is sustainable over time, with champions being rotated in and out of the program as needed. Does this framework make sense?

# GC Digital Priorities

 few key priorities for the Canadian government in terms of its digital strategy. 

- Growth: One is promoting the growth of the digital economy and creating an environment that encourages innovation. This includes things like supporting the development of 5G networks, expanding broadband access, and encouraging the development of emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing. 
- Another priority is ensuring that the benefits of the digital economy are shared equitably across all regions and demographics in Canada. This includes making sure that everyone has access to digital skills training and that there is a diverse representation of voices in the digital economy.

## Quantum

It's still early days for quantum computing, but there's a lot of excitement about the potential impact it could have. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize a number of industries, from healthcare to finance to transportation. Quantum computers are much faster than traditional computers at certain tasks, such as solving complex problems or creating sophisticated algorithms. For now, quantum computing is mostly confined to research labs and has yet to see widespread commercial use, but the early signs are promising. In Canada, there's been a lot of investment in quantum computing research, including government funding and the establishment of a national quantum strategy.

## Digital Services: Workplace

One of the biggest impacts of technology advances on user expectations for digital services is the increased demand for convenience and speed. With the rise of smartphones and mobile apps, people are used to being able to access services instantly and on-the-go. This has led to expectations for services that are available 24/7, can be accessed from anywhere, and have minimal wait times. People also expect digital services to be personalized and tailored to their specific needs. In addition, technology advances have made people more aware of security risks, so they expect digital services to be secure and trustworthy.

### Need the "conduct business aspect""

- businesses need to be able to provide digital services that are **convenient**, fast, and secure. 
- businesses need to be able **to adapt** to new technologies and keep up with the pace of change. Third, 
- businesses need to be **able to personalize** their services and tailor them to individual customers. 
- businesses need to be able to communicate with their customers in a way that is **transparent** and builds **trust**. 

All of these changes require businesses to rethink their operations and invest in new technologies and processes.

### Helps use attract and retain

First, providing high-quality digital services can be a major selling point for talented people who are looking for a company that embraces innovation and modern technologies. Second, the ability to offer personalized services that are tailored to individual needs can help create a sense of loyalty and engagement among employees. In this way, meeting **user expectations through digital services** can create a competitive advantage for businesses when it comes to hiring and retaining top talent.

- selling point; looking for a company that embraces innovation and modern technologies
- offer personalized services that are tailored to individual needs can help create a sense of loyalty and engagement among employees
