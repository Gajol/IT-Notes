# Complex Systems

In the Cynefin framework, a complex system is characterized by its inherent uncertainty and the presence of multiple interacting elements that can produce unexpected outcomes. Here are some key measures you can use to identify a complex system:

**1.** **High** **Uncertainty:** Complex systems are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, and it can be difficult to predict their behavior or outcomes based on past experience or current conditions.

**2.** **Interdependence:** The elements within a complex system are highly interdependent, and changes in one part of the system can have ripple effects throughout the rest of the system.

**3.** **Adaptive** **Behavior:** Complex systems are often self-organizing and adaptive, meaning they can respond and adapt to changes in their environment in a way that is not predetermined or programmed.

**4.** **Emergent** **Properties:** Complex systems can exhibit emergent properties, or behaviors and characteristics that arise from the interactions between their elements, rather than being inherent in the individual elements themselves.

**5.** **Feedback** **Loops:** Complex systems often contain feedback loops, where the outcomes of one process influence the inputs of another process, creating a dynamic and adaptive system.

## Leadership & Solution Systems

**1.** **Interconnectedness:** Complex problems are often interconnected and interdependent, with multiple causes, effects, and stakeholders. This makes it difficult to isolate and solve individual problems in isolation.

**2.** **Unpredictability:** Complex problems are often unpredictable, and the outcomes of decisions or interventions can be difficult to forecast. This makes it challenging to develop effective solutions and assess their impact.

**3.** **Emergence:** Complex problems often exhibit emergent properties, or unanticipated consequences and outcomes, that arise from the interactions between different elements of the system. This makes it challenging to anticipate and plan for all potential outcomes.

**4.** **Non-Linearity:** Complex problems often exhibit non-linear relationships between cause and effect, where small changes can lead to disproportionate or unexpected outcomes. This makes it difficult to predict and control the impact of interventions.

**5.** **Adaptation:** Complex problems often involve systems that adapt and change over time, in response to internal and external influences. This requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment of solutions and interventions.

**6.** **Uncertainty:** Complex problems often involve high levels of uncertainty, where the available information is incomplete, contradictory, or changing. This makes it challenging to develop accurate and effective solutions.

**7.** **Wickedness:** Complex problems are often described as "wicked problems," which are problems that are difficult or impossible to solve definitively, due to their complexity and interconnectedness.

# Rube Goldberg

A Rube Goldberg machine is a good example of a complex system. Rube Goldberg machines are elaborate contraptions designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and overly complicated way, often involving a chain reaction of events triggered by a series of simple machines.

In the context of complex systems, a Rube Goldberg machine exhibits many of the characteristics of a complex system, such as:

**1.** **Interconnectedness:** Rube Goldberg machines consist of multiple interconnected elements, where the outcome of one element triggers the next.

**2.** **Emergence:** The final outcome of a Rube Goldberg machine is often emergent, arising from the interactions between the individual elements rather than being predetermined.

**3.** **Adaptation:** Rube Goldberg machines often adapt to changes in their environment, such as adjustments to the timing or position of individual elements.

**4.** **Non-Linearity:** Rube Goldberg machines often exhibit non-linear relationships between cause and effect, where small changes can lead to disproportionate outcomes.

**5.** **Uncertainty:** Rube Goldberg machines can be unpredictable, with outcomes that are difficult to anticipate or control.

Overall, while Rube Goldberg machines are primarily designed as whimsical and entertaining contraptions, they also provide a useful metaphor for understanding the dynamics and characteristics of complex systems.
