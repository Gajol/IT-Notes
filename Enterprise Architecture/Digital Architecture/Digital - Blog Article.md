# Digital - Blog Article

## TO DO 

what is objective of presentation: understand what digital is, to government, and to CSIS

side bar:

- all stories have a Canadian angle
- skydome, dragonboat (bustin out + [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_survivors%27_dragon_boating))
- 3 C's - fall colours

only that that is constant is change

complexity versus complicated

leadership mindsets Phil Gratton - address the need to adapt

- adapt to adopt
- no alternative

zoomer = digital native

Organization

- what makes us ddifferent
- need new ways or working, risk management and appetite versus aversion
  - encourage adopting technology to the benefit of the business
  - outcomes: integrity, accountability, observability, transparency
- Ideas
  - single calendar, synchronized calendar
  - employee directory
  - reduced accounts to remember: focus on SSO of prioritized applications
  - agile deliver model
  - embrace transformation: adapt to adopt technology (especially SaaS)
  - vision: where do we want to be.

create environments for success 

human-centric

empowerment: self-service, automation; compared to process and slower channels like phone and email

what is a service versus a product

digital mindset

- design thinking, systems thinking, product management

missing: but originally part of goal of presentation

- where do we want to be
- product management: discover, alpha, beta, ship.  Ux projects/products ([UXDX model](https://www.uxdx.com/model/)) - employee, client, business experience
- experience vs user-friendly (Ux versus) - I described ordering a coffee at McDonalds''  UI intuitive is the experience using the digital technology, Ux is the experience with the overall goal ("Get a coffee the way I like it").

- critical thinking ([Eric Wildberg - TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/erick_wilberding_this_tool_will_help_improve_your_critical_thinking)) - method  draws out individuals unexamined assumptions and challenges those assumptions and biases
  - Socratic Method
  - Question Oriented Approach 
  - Draw out individual unexamined assumptions

- roles of digital architect
  - lead digitization transformation and change
  - form solutions, guide technology and business development
  - innovate
  - leverage technoloyg
  - Ideation, Conceptualization, User Requirements, Technical Journey
- tools
  - premortems

closing

- books I have enjoyed: think fast, think slow, ask better questions, rewired

others: 

- prioritization models

3. Include Accessibility:  genericallyo shift-left qquality (bilingaul, security, privayc, accessiblity)
4. work in Open : be transparent
5. Empower Staff
6. Collaborate Widely
7. Design Ethical Services

| Skydome     | Iterate: Agile[^agile-simplicity] | Realistic Ambition 1) Scope of Project: realistic scale, <br />Engineering Challenges: Roof was feasible and had been tested and proven in previous projects.  Big-O used untested design (angled arch, cable suspension, kevlar roof) - proved problematic, engineer flaws due to complexity, cost overruns, roof abandonnment.<br />Budget and Timeline: Skydome 4-years $570M,  Big-O over 6-years, $1.5B (most expensive stadium in world for years) |  |
|  | Shift-Left Quality | Skydome had clear goals, a retractable roof able to seat 50,000 people.  This was within known engineering capabilities.  This allowed engineer to meet or exceed quality expectations resulting in a stadium functioning for over 35 years with the possibility to serve the community for years to come.   In comparison, Big-O never achieved the business outcomes, the roof is seldom used (only 88X in lifetime) and it has proven to be a risk to public health with structures failing and the fire department recommending condemning it at points in time. |  |
| Dragonboard | experiment         | common belief and culture - exercise is good, comraderie     |      |
| Dragonboat  | empowered team     | create environment for success, mindsets for success, organization level, and personal level |  |
| Butterfly | Use Open Standards | Canadian zoologist Fred Urquhart and his wife Norah in 1991 used citizen-scientists to track the monarch migration. |  |
|  | Iterate | Fred Urquart struggled for decades to [perfect a gummed label](https://texasbutterflyranch.com/2022/08/11/a-history-of-monarch-tagging-and-a-happy-30th-birthday-to-monarch-watch/) that would stick and stay on a butterfly's wing.   Distribute 200,000 tags, maybe half are used, only 300-900 recovered in Mexico.  Recovery rate of 1%. |  |
|  | Collaborate Widely | Glue adhesive: Originally hole-punch and vial of glue.  Eventually 3M provided self-adhesive option. |  |
|  | Complex Problems | Protecting monarchs requires multi-national, multi-jurisdictation, multi-domain (government, local, scientific, education, ...) collaboration. |  |

# Leadership Mindsets : Phil Gratton CSPS

Leaders are not IT people, and, leaders need to understand core concepts of IT to benefit from digital.

- need to adapt
- there is no alternative

Leaders must create the environment for success.   Leaders must have the mindset for success.

- organizational success
- personal success: help transformation at a higher level

Book: Growth Mindset: Carol Dweck

- problem solving
- decision making
- emotional intelligence
- learning mindset: uncertainty, see challenges as opportunties, prepare for uncertainty.
- culture: continuous learning, collaboration, naturally curious

Immediate, urgent and reversible decisions

Johari window:  Let them know why you are learning

Show some vulnerability, be transparent.  

- For example, when hosts make mistakes n Zoom calls it helps others feel more comfortable, and, the meetings have a more human feel.
- confront the fear of making mistakes, EQ (Emotional Quotient) in the room raises, especially in online, virtual meetings

Leaders

- must learn how technology can help them.
- this is beyond the traditional HR, Finance and Policy, but understanding how cloud can help them.
- learn plan examples
  - I will three (3) books on digital transformation
  - I will attend a conference that aims to transform government

Only thing that is constant is change.  Complexity. 

Phil explains complicated (single SME can understand) to complex (impact of changes not known immediately, and hard to associate changes to impact).

[^agile-simplicity]: The [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) include being agile.  The [agile manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) includes Simplicity: Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
