# Digital - Work Smarter

Synchrony (*see Zotero - Cuiture books): started research this based on the "do more with less" and "do less, better"

1. Prioritize Ruthlessly: distinguish urgent from important
2. Leverage Technology: automate, AI, project tracking
3. Set Smarter Goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-boutn
4. Implement Systems: Beyond goals, create systems (increase sales, versus "call 10 new leads every day")
5. Delegate Effectively: delegate to free up time for productive tasks
6. Embrace the Power of "No": Be selective with time & energy
7. Manage Energy, Not Just Time:  work in bursts, 90 - 120 minutes at a time prevents burn-out
8. Reflect and Adjust: What worked, what didn't.  Continuous improvement.  Adaptability to change and learning from experiences are critical components of sustained productivity.
