# Challenges

Whare is the value of digital and digital architect in the context of these challenges:

- Sophisticated adversaries, democracy, deep fakes (leverage opportunity, detect deep fake/CSE
- resistance to change: mindsets
- HUMINT info: changing patterns of life
- Compliiexity / Senstivity
- Reosurces, People, staffing, expectations in modern world
- Bureaucracy
- Governance, Legislative : compliance, accessibility, bilingualism, privacy, security
- Vertical accountability

CIO Trust: Gratton Discussion with a/CIO

- trust: establish conditions and expectations for success
- 5-10 years ago there would be no digital ambition, digital strategy and digital plan
  - today, designing systems and services is aobut trust
  - CIO''s kept systems running (CIO's were essentially CTO's).   Today, the conversation is on the service-side and not the technology.

# Definitions

Service: Service delivery to Canadians is the responsibility of federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, sometimes jointly or in coordination.

Digital: Applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to people’s raised expectations. — GOV.UK Tom Loosemore 2017

- versus paper, in-person visits, phone calls, online fill-and-print

# Services - Federal Government

[Federal service](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/transparency/briefing-documents-treasury-board-canada-secretariat/briefing-book-minister-digital/introductory-briefing-minister-digital-government.html) delivery focuses primarily on:

- Transfers (e.g., entitlements, benefits, grants and contributions)
- Advisory services (e.g., 1-800-Ocanada, Weather Services, research and case management)
- Educational, recreational and cultural encounters (e.g., heritage museums, Parks Canada centers, Canada School of Public Service training and Red Seal Certifications)
- Regulatory compliance and enforcement (e.g., identity documents such as passport and Social Insurance Number, certificates, licenses and permits)
- Rule-making (e.g., directives and standards, laws and regulations as with the [Canada Gazette](https://canadagazette.gc.ca/accueil-home-eng.html), and policies and strategies)

Most public-facing services are delivered by eight core service organizations.

1. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)
2. Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
3. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)
4. Innovation Science and Economic Development (ISED)
5. Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC)
6. Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC)

# Why

Form and Function: Digital looks at both aspects, the function (the ability to complete a task or capability) and form (the ability of users to use the technology) - brings in DEI, accessibility (of users, for users, where, when and how), 

Empowered:  No sense about risk appetite and risk management if we continue to be risk averse.  We need to work with all stakeholders to investigate new ideas of working, new ways to leverage technology.

## Digital to a teenager: 

"Digital refers to technologies that store, generate, or process data as binary digits (0s and 1s), and include devices like computers, smartphones, and the internet."

Our digital ecosystem : 100's of apps, half-a-hundred networks, nation-wide workers, foreign deployed workers in dangerous operating environments. Must operating under strict GC directives, as well as meet levels to secure the information and people commensurate with information that is of national security interest.

- wow - that's something to be proud of.  We have many technical challenges and risks - workloads require security to a high-level which often means "air-gap" non cloud-native solutions.   
- people's lives have changed - they are digital -  most peoples world lives in technology
  - story: factory reset phone - lost valuable information.

Digital Architect to a Group of Developers

I have an opportunity to influence strategic thinking.

- it is limited, boxed - many other strategies / branches
- digital strategy should be led by business (not by technology)

# Key Points I would to Convey:

- Complexity
- Change / Innovation
- Psychological Safety - how to fit this in
- Challenges (x, y, z) - need flexibility in operating model (lifecycle)
- Human-centric, people-centric
  - Hey,  this is a room full of technical experts, developers, there is an urgency for improving the developer experience (DevX):  Emerging technology is a differentiator and crucial part of our business.  Technical talent is more important than ever.  Our ways of working are not efficient.  What percentage of time do our developers spend on feature development?  To attract and retain the best tech talent, developer experience, of DevEx, a developer-first mindset aim at improving a software developers day-to-day productivity and satisfaction by considering every touchpoint with the organization.   This is more than co-pilot, and includes considering how we can enable citizen developers across the business to drive value through technology. (Deloitte Tech Trends 2024)

## Innovation Challenge : Complexity / HUMINT

Innovation is a challenge for many HUMINT (Human Intelligence) organizations for several reasons:

**1.** **Traditional** **Mindsets:** Many HUMINT organizations have been operating in a particular way for a long time, and there can be resistance to change or adoption of new technologies and processes. This can create a culture that is not always conducive to innovation.

**2.** **Complexity** **and** **Sensitivity:** HUMINT work often deals with highly sensitive and complex information, which means that any changes or innovations need to be carefully evaluated and implemented in a way that ensures the safety and integrity of classified information.

**3.** **Lack** **of** **Resources:** HUMINT organizations often have limited resources and funding, which can make it difficult to invest in new technologies or train employees on new methods.

**4.** **Inertia** **and** **Bureaucracy:** The nature of government work can lead to a high level of bureaucracy and red tape, making it challenging to implement changes and innovations in a timely manner.

Overall, the challenge for HUMINT organizations is to strike a balance between maintaining security and effectiveness, while also being open to new ideas and ways of working that can drive innovation and improve performance.

HUMINT (Human Intelligence) is characterized by complex information for several reasons:

**1.** **Human** **Factors:** HUMINT involves gathering and analyzing information from human sources, which can be inherently complex and unpredictable. People have different perspectives, motivations, and biases, which can impact the reliability and accuracy of the information they provide.

**2.** **Cultural** **and** **Linguistic** **Differences:** HUMINT often involves working with sources from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, which can add complexity to the process of gathering and interpreting information. Misunderstandings and cultural differences can lead to inaccuracies or misinterpretations.

**3.** **Sensitive** **and** **Classified** **Information:** HUMINT often deals with sensitive and classified information, which requires careful handling and analysis. This can add complexity to the process of gathering, storing, and analyzing intelligence.

**4.** **Disinformation** **and** **Deception:** HUMINT sources may intentionally provide false or misleading information to protect their own interests or to confuse or mislead the intelligence agency. Identifying and countering disinformation adds another layer of complexity to HUMINT operations.

**5.** **Volatility** **and** **Uncertainty:** The geopolitical landscape is constantly changing, and HUMINT sources may not always have access to the most up-to-date or accurate information. This can make it challenging to make informed decisions based on HUMINT alone.

Overall, the complexity of HUMINT information stems from the human factors involved, cultural and linguistic differences, the sensitive nature of the information, the potential for disinformation, and the volatility and uncertainty of the geopolitical landscape.

## Logic Theory

Logic theory is important for HUMINT (Human Intelligence) officers in several ways:

**1.** **Critical** **Thinking:** Logic theory teaches HUMINT officers how to identify and analyze arguments, evidence, and hypotheses in a structured and rational manner. This is critical for making sound decisions based on complex and often incomplete information.

**2.** **Analytical** **Reasoning:** Logic theory provides tools and techniques for analyzing complex problems, identifying logical inconsistencies, and developing solutions. This is especially useful in situations where HUMINT officers need to piece together fragments of information to develop a complete picture of a situation.

**3.** **Debriefing** **Techniques:** Logic theory can be applied to questioning and debriefing techniques, helping HUMINT officers to identify and challenge inconsistencies in a source's story and to develop follow-up questions that can lead to deeper insights and more reliable information.

**4.** **Counterintelligence:** Logic theory can also help HUMINT officers identify and counter disinformation, deception, and propaganda. By understanding logical fallacies and biases, HUMINT officers can develop strategies for detecting and countering these tactics.

Debriefing techniques refer to structured methods used to gather information from individuals who have firsthand experience or knowledge of a particular event, situation, or operation. Debriefing techniques are commonly used in intelligence gathering, law enforcement, military operations, and other fields that require detailed and accurate information.

### Debriefing Techniques

Some common debriefing techniques include:

**1.** **Initial** **Briefing:** The debriefer provides the source with an overview of the purpose and objectives of the debriefing, and sets expectations for the process.

**2.** **Building** **Rapport:** The debriefer establishes a rapport with the source, creating a sense of trust and comfort to encourage open and honest communication.

**3.** **Open-Ended** **Questions:** The debriefer asks open-ended questions to encourage the source to provide as much detail as possible, and to avoid leading the source or influencing their responses.

**4.** **Follow-Up** **Questions:** The debriefer asks follow-up questions to clarify information, probe for more details, and challenge inconsistencies or discrepancies in the source's account.

**5.** **Memory-Aids:** The debriefer uses memory-aids such as maps, timelines, or photographs to help the source remember and describe specific events or details.

**6.** **Documentation:** The debriefer takes detailed notes or records the debriefing session to capture all relevant information and ensure that nothing is missed.

**7.** **Feedback** **and** **Closure:** The debriefer provides feedback to the source on the usefulness of their information, answers any questions they may have, and closes the debriefing session in a professional and respectful manner.

Debriefing techniques are designed to maximize the amount and accuracy of information obtained from a source, while also minimizing the risk of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

## Quotes

There is none so blind as those who will not see — English idiom 16th century



## Quotes maybe worth saying:

### Transformation - not optmization/modernization

Take a more fundamental approach, reimagine what the business should ideally look like a few years from now, and the work backwards.  Re-engineer every aspect, from the operating model and workforce to the products and experiences, to deliver the required outcomes as productively as possible. (source Accenture - Banking on AI - 2023)

- compared to traditional Kaizen/Kanban Lean concepts established over 50 years ago.

### Ux

Understand how you can use your craft in a way that is [not just focused on the task at hand](https://uxdesign.cc/product-design-is-going-down-a-weird-path-but-we-can-still-save-it-8c777ef2bbf8), but also enhancing the user experience and connecting their full digital ecosystem. Solving the right problem is as important as solving it right. - [The State of UX in 2024 (uxdesign.cc)](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/)

### Human  Centric

- "Being in the business of human services requires thinking about how, and where, and when to interact with the government." 

- My challenge is how to make this a relevant ambition giving our constraints; priorities, budget, resources, security posture.  

### Problem to Solve / Mindshift

(From Gratton / Wagner Talk) What is the problem we are trying to solve?

- are their linkages to other problems or services that make sense to connect together (regardless if it's another department, regardless if it's another mandate)

  - leadership and the courage that we need to have, as public servants
  - So, really a bit of a mind shift. As I said at the beginning, this is a little bit different than you see in the past where we'll talk about some technical debt, and I'll get to that for sure. But this is really at the basis of how we're starting to think about how we design services.

# Story

## Future Proof Intelligence Operations in the Digital Age

A good theme for telling a digital architecture story to a HUMINT agency full of technical people could be "Future-Proofing Intelligence Operations in the Digital Age."

The theme highlights the importance of digital architecture in ensuring that intelligence operations are future-proofed against rapidly evolving technological advances. It emphasizes the need for digital architects to work with technical people in the HUMINT agency to create a technology roadmap that aligns with the agency's strategic goals, while also taking into account emerging trends and innovations in areas such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.

By choosing this theme, you can delve into the specific challenges that HUMINT agencies face in the digital age, such as staying ahead of sophisticated adversaries who use advanced technologies, and ensuring that intelligence operations remain efficient, secure, and effective. This theme also emphasizes the critical role that digital architects play in shaping the future of HUMINT agencies in the digital age.

Overall, "Future-Proofing Intelligence Operations in the Digital Age" provides a compelling narrative that will resonate with technical people in a HUMINT agency, and could serve as an excellent starting point for discussing the value and importance of digital architecture in this context.

CDS briefing to Minister: [Introductory briefing to the Minister of Digital Government - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/transparency/briefing-documents-treasury-board-canada-secretariat/briefing-book-minister-digital/introductory-briefing-minister-digital-government.html)

Considerations for advancing the digital agenda.  Delivering on digital will require the Government of Canada to:

1. Address the government’s **aging IT infrastructure** and **legacy IT spending**
2. Modernize **how government delivers services**
3. Solidify the **government’s enterprise capacity**, including deploying **common platforms** that support **seamless service delivery** 

[CDS 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230214184644/https://digital.canada.ca/roadmap-2025/): **Digitize all public-facing government services so they are accessible by web and mobile phone and available behind a unified login system by 2025.**

**In November 2018, [CDS accepted the Table’s challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20230214184644/https://twitter.com/kathleenmonk/status/1060576882528268288)** to consider: What would it take for the Government of Canada to deliver its public-facing services digitally by 2025?

- CDS does not have the authority to decide on behalf of government to make this a priority. But part of CDS’s mandate is to provide advice to government about digital service delivery. In that spirit, we offer the beginning of a roadmap for how the Government of Canada could rise to the Table’s challenge.
- **Then, for each target service: **https://digital.canada.ca/roadmap-2025/
  - **Assign a single responsible owner**
  - **Empower the service owner**: The service owner doesn’t need to be a technology expert, but they need the resources, delegated authorities, and executive commitment necessary to deliver a digital service. This especially includes the ability to assemble a cross-functional team with skill sets in software development, design research, experience design, policy, program, and communications; a product manager that is empowered to own the vision for the service; and other specialized skills, including legal counsel and procurement, as required.
  - **Empower the service delivery team**
  - **Set deadlines for the key indicators of early progress**
  - **Identify outcome criteria and collect baseline metrics**
  - **Publish progress against the challenge, openly and continuously**

Common Services:

- **These should be delivered by dedicated product teams** with the same complement of design and development skills — and authorities and responsibilities — as the service delivery teams above

Remove Obstacles to service delivery

- A focus on user needs and an environment that allows for continuous improvement are two key pieces of a feedback loop that lets organizations build services that meet and exceed people’s expectations.
- To meet the Table’s challenge, it will not be sufficient to “tweak the settings” of government. In this document we’ve attempted to start with how to deliver results and then contemplate institutional constraints, rather than vice versa. Our friends in the [United Kingdom](https://web.archive.org/web/20230214184644/https://mikebracken.com/blog/the-strategy-is-delivery-again/) and the [United States](https://web.archive.org/web/20230214184644/https://www.codeforamerica.org/deliverydriven) have written at length about the necessity and impact of this inversion, and it is a primary inspiration for the existence of CDS.
- **Better align HR policy to digital service delivery.** Current job classifications don’t yet include important skills like design research, service design, and product management
- **Develop alternative means to fund agile development of services.** Rather than funding and approving entire projects before iterative delivery (and learning) begins, create lightweight, rolling means to fund projects incrementally as service delivery teams research, design, build, and continuously improve their products.

# Change Drivers

**1.** **Technological** **Advancements:** Technology is advancing at an incredible rate, and businesses and individuals must keep up to remain competitive. From AI and automation to blockchain and IoT, new technologies are disrupting traditional industries and changing the way we live and work.

**2.** **Social** **and** **Cultural** **Changes:** The world is becoming more diverse, and social and cultural changes are happening faster than ever. Organizations and individuals need to be able to adapt to changing attitudes and behaviors in order to be successful.

**3.** **Political** **and** **Economic** **Instability:** Political and economic shifts can happen quickly, leading to uncertainty and volatility. Organizations and individuals need to be agile and adaptable to navigate these changes and remain competitive.

**4.** **Globalization:** The world is more connected than ever, and businesses are operating in a global marketplace. Adapting to different cultures, languages, and regulations is critical for success.
