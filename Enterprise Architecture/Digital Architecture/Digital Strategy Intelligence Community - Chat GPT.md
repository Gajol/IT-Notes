When people order their groceries, book a holiday or check their bank accounts, they expect and receive a seamless and easy experience. The same should be true of government services.

> As the Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for digital government, I have the privilege of introducing the government’s 2022 to 2025 Roadmap for Digital and Data, Transforming for a Digital Future. This sets out our ambitions to transform digital public services, deliver world-class digital technology and systems, and attract and retain the best in digital talent. We must also drive value for money to the taxpayer, by transforming our ways of working to enable the civil service to work smarter and faster and deliver on our ambitions for widespread digital transformation.

## Strategy & Dependencies

Identifying dependencies in a digital strategy is crucial for effective planning and implementation. Dependencies are relationships or connections between different tasks, components, or initiatives that impact each other's success. Here's how you can identify dependencies in a digital strategy:

1. **Document the Strategy**:
   - Start by thoroughly documenting the digital strategy, including its objectives, goals, initiatives, and timelines. A well-documented strategy provides a clear foundation for identifying dependencies.

2. **Break Down the Strategy**:
   - Divide the digital strategy into smaller components, such as projects, tasks, or workstreams. Each of these components is a potential source of dependencies.

3. **Analyze Workflow and Processes**:
   - Review the workflows and processes involved in each component of the strategy. Identify where tasks or activities overlap or rely on each other to achieve the desired outcomes.

4. **Identify Resource Dependencies**:
   - Determine whether any components of the strategy require specific resources, such as personnel, technology, or funding, which may be shared with other components.

5. **Sequence of Activities**:
   - Examine the sequence in which activities or tasks must be completed. Dependencies often occur when one task cannot start or finish until another task is completed.

6. **Interactions with External Stakeholders**:
   - Consider interactions with external stakeholders, such as partners, vendors, regulatory bodies, or customers, and how their actions or requirements can impact the strategy.

7. **Data and Information Dependencies**:
   - Identify dependencies related to data and information flows. Determine if certain components rely on data inputs or outputs from others.

8. **Technological Dependencies**:
   - Assess whether there are technological dependencies, such as software integrations, API connections, or infrastructure requirements, that must be met to achieve strategic objectives.

9. **Risk Dependencies**:
   - Consider dependencies related to risks and contingencies. Some components may depend on risk mitigation or crisis management plans developed in other parts of the strategy.

10. **Timing and Scheduling**:
    - Examine the timing and scheduling of tasks or initiatives within the strategy. Dependencies may be related to specific timelines or deadlines.

11. **Regulatory and Compliance Dependencies**:
    - Review regulatory and compliance requirements that may affect the strategy. Dependencies can arise when compliance with certain regulations is necessary for specific initiatives.

12. **External Factors**:
    - Take into account external factors, such as market conditions, economic trends, or geopolitical events, that can impact the strategy's success and create dependencies.

13. **Cross-Functional Teams**:
    - Engage cross-functional teams or subject matter experts to provide insights into potential dependencies within their areas of expertise.

14. **Dependency Mapping Tools**:
    - Consider using project management or strategy planning tools that offer dependency mapping features. These tools can help visualize and manage dependencies more effectively.

15. **Iterative Review**:
    - Periodically review and update the dependency analysis as the digital strategy progresses. New dependencies may emerge, and existing ones may evolve.

16. **Dependency Log**:
    - Maintain a dependency log or matrix that clearly documents each identified dependency, its nature, and its impact on the strategy's execution.

17. **Communication and Collaboration**:
    - Foster open communication and collaboration among teams and stakeholders to ensure that dependencies are well-understood and managed throughout the execution of the strategy.

Identifying dependencies in a digital strategy is an ongoing process that requires careful analysis, communication, and adaptability. By proactively identifying and managing dependencies, organizations can reduce risks, optimize resource allocation, and increase the likelihood of successful strategy execution.

# Attention Economics - Modern Business Processes

A modern business process that respects attention economics should exhibit several key characteristics:

1. **Efficiency:** It should be designed to minimize time-consuming and repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus their attention on more valuable and strategic activities.

2. **Automation:** Routine tasks and processes should be automated wherever possible, reducing the cognitive load on employees and enabling them to allocate their attention to critical decision-making and creativity.

3. **Prioritization:** It should include mechanisms for identifying and prioritizing tasks, projects, and information based on their relevance and importance. This helps employees allocate their attention effectively to the most critical issues.

4. **Personalization:** Modern business processes should be able to adapt to individual preferences and work styles, allowing employees to engage with information and tasks in ways that suit them best.

5. **Data-Driven Insights:** Utilizing data analytics, these processes should provide insights into how attention is allocated within the organization, helping to optimize workflows and resource allocation.

6. **Collaboration Tools:** Business processes should integrate collaboration tools that facilitate communication and information sharing, reducing the need for time-consuming meetings and email chains.

7. **Information Filters:** Implementing filters and algorithms that reduce information overload by presenting relevant data and content while filtering out noise.

8. **Employee Well-being:** Prioritizing employee well-being by recognizing the limits of attention and promoting work-life balance, with strategies such as mindfulness practices and flexible work arrangements.

9. **Continuous Improvement:** Embracing a culture of continuous improvement to refine processes and reduce distractions, allowing employees to maintain focus on high-value tasks.

10. **Feedback Loops:** Incorporating feedback mechanisms that allow employees to provide input on the effectiveness of attention-related processes and tools.

11. **Cybersecurity Measures:** Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against digital distractions, such as phishing attacks or data breaches.

12. **Clear Communication:** Establishing clear guidelines and expectations around communication, including response times, to prevent constant interruptions and allow employees to manage their attention more effectively.

13. **Training and Education:** Providing employees with training and education on attention management techniques, including strategies for handling digital distractions and maintaining focus.

In essence, a modern business process that respects attention economics should aim to optimize the allocation of attention and cognitive resources within the organization, ensuring that employees can work efficiently and effectively in an age of information overload and digital distractions.



# Strategy 

## Vision and Mission

What is the Mission section within a strategy document

In the context of strategy documents, the "mission" section typically outlines the organization's overall purpose and goals. It describes the organization's reason for existing, as well as the problem or need it is trying to address. This section often includes a vision statement, which provides a more idealistic view of what the organization hopes to achieve. It's important to note that the mission section is different from the "objectives" or "goals" section, which is more specific and actionable.
