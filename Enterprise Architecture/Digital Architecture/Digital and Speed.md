> San Francisco proposed a [new bus lane](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/two-mile-long-van-ness-bus-lane-project-faces-two-year-delay/) on Van Ness in 2001. It opened in [2022](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/S-F-s-Van-Ness-transit-project-is-ready-after-17027218.php), yielding a project duration of around 7,600 days. “The project has been delayed due to an increase of wet weather since the project started,” said Paul Rose, a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency spokesperson. The project cost $346 million, i.e. $110,000 per meter. The Alaska Highway, mentioned above, constructed across remote tundra, cost $793 per meter in 2019 dollars.
