### Digital Quotient methodology

McKinsey’s [Digital Quotient](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/raising-your-digital-quotient)® (DQ) measures an organization’s performance in 32 practices across five key dimensions of digital maturity: strategy, organization and talent, agile delivery and culture, capabilities, and adoption and scaling (exhibit). The responses are captured on a scale of 1–5 and then converted to 0–100 scores using a nonlinear scale. Average scores greater than 3.3 are considered strengths, average scores between 2.8 and 3.3 are considered areas for improvement, and average scores less than 2.8 are considered lagging areas.
