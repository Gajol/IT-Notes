# Phil Gratton : Digital for Leaders : CSPS

Key Notes:

1. Executive culture of learning
2. Executives must learn technology just like HR & Finance
3. Executives should share a personal learning plan on digital & growth mindset

## Opportunity

- leadership skills
- executives manage and lead more moving parts
- executives create environment for maximum success
- executive mindset appropriate to the digital era
  - personal level: personal digital transformation, help at higher more collaborative level
  - growth mindset: pyschology, put into work to develop, cycle of growth and belief

## Growth mindset

- curiosity of things, of ideas; professional sheen to curiousity
- adaptable and open to new ideas
- complexity:
  - problem solving
  - adaptability
  - emotional intelligence
  - decision making
- confide, willingness, aware of more
- inspired: improved by leaders with growth mindset

## Complex, risk taking: Growth Mindset

- formal adaptation
- include training in growth mindset in individual learning plans
- executives neglect their own need to learn in these spaces
- be public, and make promises:  training, read 3 books, attend conferences on transforming government

## Learn Technology Driving Digital Transformation

- executives naturally known as they move up ladder, they must learn HR, FIN, Policy
- executives now must learn technology.  
- No need to learn how to code or architect a network.
- learn how technology can improve work, and service delivery

## Uncertainty

- digital age brings uncertainty
- only certainty is change
- online brought many fears:  fears hosting a meeting, fear of making mistakes.  This is human nature.

## Complicated vs Complex Systems

Understanding complicated versus complex systems helps executives leader transformation and program delivery:

- complex: 
  - interconnected nature of systems and people, unlimited number of variables
  - outcomes: impossible to define and predict outcomes
  - beyond reach of a single SME
  - includes many domains, and requires a multi-disciplinary team
  - no control over outcomes:  interconnected, many dependencies, hard to see cause & effect.   Hard to see ripple effect (only visible 1, 2, 3 years later)
  - results are blurry, emergent predictions hard, only see in hindsight
- complicated:
  - domain of experts: a single expert (or team of experts) can understand, manage and support system.

Generally, government is based on "playbook" approach:

- the playbook works for complicated systems
- it does not work for complex systems
- Playbook's value is saying, "but I followed the playbook"
- public service is risk averse.  Public service needs a risk appetite

Advice:

- embrace failure, what does failure look like?  How do we deal with it?
- embrace responsible risk taking: rock the boat, but stay the course
- learn from riskier decisions
- express personal digital transformation, change and adapt (or become irrelevant)
- draft and share your personal development plan: digital, flexible, make promise, share with collegues
