# Growth Mindset

Adopt leadership skills that address the challenges presented by the digital era.   This is especially important for non-IT leaders.

- digital age: throws people off, confusing and misleading.  This is not about computers and data, but about a period of unprecedented rapid transformation and forced adaptability brought on first-and-foremost by digital technologies.  Other disruptions like climate change, demographic shifts and political and economic instability, are affecting the need to change.

# Complexity

complexity is one of my favourite subjects to talk about uh complexity refers to the interconnected nature of systems right of situations of people all of these challenges that uh that have a kind of uh unknowable number of variables and connections and factors uh and in fact under complexity the connections are actually what's important that more so than the things themselves

recognizing when a system is complex is key in making the right decision about it

cynefin f/w - lead in uncertainty. Understand situation, and, make decision that best fit the situation.  (Welch - KUN-e-FIN - see CSPS)

- we confuse complex with complicated.
  - complicated is domain of experts.  You understand something that is complicate, something a non-expert would not under
  - complex - beyond area of an expert, you need a variety of experts, which is why you diversity on a team and multi-disciplinary teams is so key

Traditional decision making will fail you.

- large number of people (organziation or people) start to enter complex domain

no control of outcome

- things are so interconnected
- so many more dependencies, factors
- do not see cause-and-effect in a simple/complicated domain
- ripple effect of actions are difficult/impossible to anticipate

Shifting Change

- landscape shift dramatically before 1-2-3 year plan is executed
- you do measure performance (as Executive)

## Cynefin Framework

# Freedom to Fail

- Risk Taking
- Innovation

Personal risks that lead to positive outcomes.  Behaviours and attitudes...

- public service is risk-averse
- institution lethargy, mandates and priorities, little room to innovate (at least at the organizational level). 
- easier to stay the course
- responsible risk taking, we can all do collectively
- it is hard for any single person to be the one to take the first step
- government: we are good at mitigating risk, not good at taking risk like private sector (2 companies existing in S&P 500 from 20-years ago)
  - if you take risks, eventually you will fail, you cannot escape failure (swing the bat - no called strikes)
  - what does failure look like and how do we deal with
- you can become with taking risks at an individual scale.  Take repsonsible risks at individual level and see how it reverberates.
  - desire to be like the others.  Keeps us from doing things and wanting things.  But this is the space where innovate takes place.

Complexity, Decision-Making & Results

- decision making behaviour - best outcomes: playbook approach works well in complicated doamin

- when it doesn't work: "at least we followed the playbook"

- complexity : playbook is blurry, results don't replicate, emergent situations that noone could predict, only seen in hindsight (Lies, Spies and Algorithms)

- anything done outside "playbook" is innovation & risk taking.  Give yourself to experiment, to take a few risks, to have room to fail, and learn from those failures.

  - Take good risks: Understanding complexity allows you to see where and when to take the risks
  - Individual Level: take a risk in your learning, take a small risk and develop a growth mindset.  Add an element that are unorthodox, something that someone in your position would not consider.
  - Next steps that make you  feel uncomfortable.  You learn more from the riskier decisions you take. Curiousity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought him back.

  ## Mindset Embrace

  Manage personal digital transformation.  Change how you lead.  

  Change and adaptation, you will become irrelevant without adaptation
