tags: design thinking, management theory, questions

In design thinking and user experience, user research is a recognized role to gather inforamtion about a user's journey and emotions using a product or service.   The ability to develop empathy for a user is improved with inquiring questions.  Ed Schein's Humble Inquiry book is often cited as a good source for improving ones ability to inquire.  

Ed Schein, was a leader in management theory and worked with MIT Sloan ([reference](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/5-enduring-management-ideas-mit-sloans-edgar-schein)).  Some of his most enduring ideas are:

coercive persuasion:  Basied on interviewing USA POWs from the Korean war, he realized one can be influenced with physically captive.  He paralleled this to [golden handcuffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenhandcuffs.asp), 

> If I’m economically committed to institution, I have tenure, I am going to allow myself — or be forced — to be socialized into their culture. There is no gain in being a dissident or a deviant if I’m stuck there. If I’m stuck there, I’m going to sooner or later be influenced. — Ed Schein

career anchors and dynamics: A persons career is constrained by motivational, attitudinal and value syndrome.  What motivates a person to work?  What are their values? How do employees want to be managed?  These answers determine a persons career anchor.  [Career Anchors - Ed Schein](https://www.amazon.com/Career-Anchors-Changing-Careers-Assessment).  Eight anchors:

1. managerial competence 
2. technical / functional competence 
3. entrepreneurial creativity
4. autonomy/independence
5. security/stability
6. service/dedication to a cause
7. pure challenge
8. lifestyle

organizational culture:  [Organizational Culture and Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Organizational-Culture-Leadership-Edgar-Schein/dp/0470190604).  Organizational cultures can be assessed on three levels:

- artifacts: the architecture, office layout, technology, dress code, visible and audible behaviour patterns, public documents on employee orientation
- values: the reasons why members behave the way they do in the organization
- assumptions: unconscious pattern that determines how members perceive, think and feel

humble inquiry leadership: self-effacing inquiry is the art of drawing someone out by asking questions to which you do not already know the answer, thereby building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.— [Humble Inquiry](https://www.amazon.com/Humble-Inquiry-Gentle-Instead-Telling/dp/1609949811) & [Humble Leadership](https://www.bkconnection.com/books/title/Humble-Leadership).

> Our culture emphasizes that leaders must be wiser, set direction, and articulate values, all of which predisposes them to tell rather than ask.  Yet it is leaders who will need humble inquiry most, because complex interdependent tasks will require building positive, trusting relationships with subordinates to facilitate good upward communication —Ed Schein

organizational change: A method for shifting culture within an organization. [Organizational Culture and Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Organizational-Leadership-Jossey-Bass-Business-Management-dp-1119212049/dp/1119212049/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).  Identified tools leaders have available to them:

- What a leader regularly focuses on, measures, rewards, controls and inquires about
