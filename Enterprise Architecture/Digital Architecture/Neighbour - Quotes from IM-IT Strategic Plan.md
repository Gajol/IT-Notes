# Neighbour - Quotes from IM-IT Strategic Plan

Modern knowledge workplaces are not defined by physical characteristics, but rather by the behaviours and interactions of its workforce. Individuals inhabiting modern knowledge workplaces are mobile with ubiquitous access to electronic data and resources, are equipped with leading-edge electronic tools and collaborate by communicating openly.

# What is Foreign signals intelligence collection

Foreign signals intelligence collection, also known as SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), is the practice of gathering, processing, and analyzing electronic communications and other signals from foreign countries or entities for the purpose of gathering intelligence and national security. This can include various forms of electronic communication, such as phone calls, emails, text messages, and other digital signals.

The goal of foreign signals intelligence collection is to provide insights into foreign governments, organizations, and individuals, as well as potential threats to national security. It is often conducted by intelligence agencies, military organizations, and other government entities, using a range of technical methods and tools, such as:

**1.** **Signal** **interception:** Using antennae, satellites, and other equipment to intercept and capture electronic signals from foreign sources.

**2.** **Decryption:** Using sophisticated algorithms and software to decrypt encrypted signals and access the underlying content.

**3.** **Analysis:** Using data analysis and data science techniques to extract insights and intelligence from the collected signals.

**4.** **Human** **intelligence:** Leveraging human sources, such as informants or agents, to gather signals intelligence and other information.

Foreign signals intelligence collection is an important part of national security efforts, but it can also be controversial due to concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and international relations.
