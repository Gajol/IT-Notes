Our mission is to protect Canada and its citizens through four pillars of digital strategy: digital services, digital workforce, digital workplace and digital foundation. We will work tirelessly to ensure that these pillars are realized, and that our department is always operating with the highest standards of transparency, accountability and respect for the rule of law

## CSIS

**Our vision**: A safe, secure and prosperous Canada, through trusted intelligence and advice.

CSIS is at the forefront of Canada's national security system. Our role is to investigate activities suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada and to report on these to the Government of Canada. We may also take measures to reduce threats to the security of Canada in accordance with well-defined legal requirements and Ministerial Direction.


*Protecting National Security in Partnership with all Canadians* 

Pivotal Moment in History

> No one in this room, or listening virtually, would be surprised to hear that I believe that we are currently in the midst of a pivotal moment in history. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the unpredictability of the current environment. Geopolitical, economic, societal, environmental and technological changes are all converging to reshape the world around us at an accelerating pace. People everywhere, including in Canada, are contending with the human, social and economic impacts of these transformations. These trends are impacting our threat environment, and in turn, CSIS as an intelligence agency. — CSIS Director David Vigneault, [May 4, 2022 UBC](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/news/2022/05/remarks-by-director-david-vigneault-to-the-university-of-british-columbia.html)

Modern Workforce:

> We are currently in the midst of transformative change aimed at modernizing our workforce to respond to these challenges. Since our people still need to come to the office, we are committed to making it the best possible workplace. At the same time, we are working to leverage technology to enable more flexible working arrangements, harness the power of data, and recruit the digital-native intelligence professionals of tomorrow. — [CSIS UBC](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/news/2022/05/remarks-by-director-david-vigneault-to-the-university-of-british-columbia.html)

## Drivers

Technology has revolutionized every aspect of our society including the way ACME delivers on its mandate.  The digital strategy defines ACME's ambitions to transform digital products, services and technology and attract and retain digital talent.  Digital and data are the foundations for a leading intelligence organization.  Adapting to new challenges, effective decision-making and meeting client expectations is only feasible with skilled digital experts,  modern digital technology, leveraging quality data in a culture supporting innovation.  The changing digital landscape has created many drives necessitating the need for a digital strategy.  These drivers can be grouped into operationing landscape changes and chronic pain points:

### Operating Landscape Challenges

- **Disruptive Technology**: Rapid advancements in technology like artificial intelligence, cloud adoption, ~~cyber threats~~, internet of things (IoT) and edge computing are transforming the intelligence landscape.  The digital strategy aims to leverage these technologies to improve data collection, analysis, and security.
- **State Actors and Global Connectivity**: The internet has connected the world digitally.  Threats and adversaries can operate across borders more easily.  The digital strategy establishes collaboration with international partners to share information more effectively.

- **Employee Experience / Changing Expectations**: Rapid changes in technology and the dramatic shift-to-digital during the pandemic have changes how Canadians do business.  Employees expect and deserve similar experiences in the workplace.  Employee expectations include digital tools to streamline their work processes, engaging communication and collaboration platforms, workplace flexibility.   The prevalence of technology, and cyber threats have also increased employees need to trust in the security and privacy of their personal information.  Modern solutions are required to attract and retain the talented workers required to fulfil our mandate.

- **Public Trust and Accountability**: There is growing expectations for ACME to be transparent and account.  The digital strategy guidance to modernize intelligence sharing, dissemination and disclosure to help foster trust by Canadian's in ACME.

- **Competitive Advantage**: ACME needs to leverage digital technology to stay ahead of the threats.  The digital strategy provides a completive advantage by enabling innovative approaches to intelligence lifecycle with case management and compliance solutions.

- **Core Drivers / GC Digital Imperative**:  The Government of Canada digital imperative, the GC Digital Ambition, necessitates that ACME modernize and provide secure and digital services. ACME's programs and services are expected to be optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.

### Chronic Business Pain Points

The following persistent pain points have impeded business efficiency and effectiveness.  The Digital Strategy strives to improve by using automation and adopting enterprise digital standard solutions.

- **Significant Technology Debt**:  Many of our aging systems are unable to meet our business user's expectations.  The ongoing costs to support and manage aging technology and impact on employee morale impedes ACME's ability to acquire digital talent and invest resources on more capable technology solutions.  

- **Manual Inefficient Processes**: The majority of business processes are complex and require significant attention and effort.    Following modern process practices reduces the cognitive load XXXLKJLKJD

> “...a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...”
> ― Herbert A. Simon Nobel Laureate
>
> "Time in an attention economy is the only scarce commodity."  — Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft

- **Service Desk Frustration**:  The high-rate of calls to the Service Desk reduces its ability to respond timely.  Account password resets continues to consume significant call centre resources due to a lack of  password management capabilities which would enable the user to self-manage their passwords. 
- **Risk aversion**.  TODO: The culture of change is averse to accepting risk.  The ability to identify hybrid approaches to risk acceptance and management is needed.   A desire to manage risk, but the inability of risk to be transferred and accepted by business owners.  Governance, including risk management, should align with the complexity of the solution enabling rapid, adaptable solutions. ( IS owns risk and risk management )
- **Others** ???
  - Not Using Our Data: Cannot Fully Leverage Data
  - Isolated Systems: Disconnected / Siloed Information and Knowledge
  - Dated Communication: Our employee engagement platforms do not have the capabilties to engage employees in modern, meaningful methods.  
  - Inability to Work from Home: Very few of our business processes and information can be conducted without physically being at the office.
  - No common understanding of technical capability catalog (application catalog) 
  - ?? Lacking mobile worker concerns - mobile ops, @stations/posts, @doe??
- TODO: Consider simplifying: **GAC is more simple : 4 drivers:**
  - Need for Agility, GC Digital Direction, Changing Expectations, Cyber Security (tech debt / ATO)

TODO:

> TODO: Deputy CIO : Enterprise solutions enforcement (check CSPS discussion notes)
>
> Jackey: laundry list of specific pain points (encrypted email?, )

# Checklist

The following checklist identifies key-points from stakeholders and other sources.  The purpose is to validate and discuss whether these are important in to consider in the strategy.

## Gartner | Sylvie

- [ ] Does Digital Strategy focus on culture, operating model, organization structure and talent?  Recommend to focus on <u>not</u> focus on projects.   Also focusing on "compliance" does <u>not</u> work.
- [ ] Timelines & Roadmap:  Should the strategy lay-out near-term / long-term roadmap?

## Jackey

- [ ] Driver: Future of HUMINT.  We need to decide what we need to be good at.  What we can outsource and partner with.  How do we enable the business as a technology team?
- [ ] What Do We Need.  The dependencies Jackey identified in the "Food For Thought" slide deck.  Where does this belong in the strategy?  In the strategy or in the departmental plan?

## Dave B

- [ ] Why Digital Strategy?  Prevalence of technology.  We have to be where the action is.  We need to extend operations to the cloud.  We need to be efficient in technology.  The tools (technology) needs to be fit-for-purpose.
- [ ] Business-Led:  Does the Digital Strategy need to define, guide on business led and identify this as a strategic objective?   What would be strategic-objective :arrow_right: strategic initiative :arrow_right: goals? 
- [ ] Goal: Hybrid Development / Citizen Developer: Different governance based on complexity of solution.  Changing governance, roles & responsibilities based on the complexity.
- [ ] ? Establish EA practice, services, governance (policies, standards, reference architectures supporting, critical business processes, ...)
- [ ] Other Considerations
  - [ ] Gartner Recommendations from #1 / #2
  - [ ] Org Changes : Cap. Hub, ...
  - [ ] Shared Infrast...
  - [ ] Why will this succeed vs past?  Lessons learned adopted/ applied/consultaitons - Leadership
  - [ ] Personas - Future of Work - DDA
  - [x] 3-5years key-factors affecting us (air-gap safe solutions, digital talent, retention, change threat/tech, debt, ...) - are these not the "drivers"?

## GAC

- [ ] Keys to Success:  Their DPSP identifies Keys to Success: Requirements to Support Digital Transformation: Invest in Digital, Focus on Talent, Increase Digital and Data Literacy and Evolve our IM/IT Operating Model.  Where does this belong in the "Digital Strategy"?   In the "Measure" section?

## General

- [ ] Mindset and Culture:  Learning mindset, growth mindset (versus fixed mindset) - learning from opportunities.
- [ ] People:  Equipping people with the organizational knowledge, skills and adaptability to be effective in a digital environment (TODO: reword)
- [ ] Business: Capabilities & Services:  We are lacking an endorsed business capabilities and service-catalog lists.   Services can be GC-services and/or internal-services (both operational and adminsitrative)

# Glossary

Agile Product Management: Agile product management is a modern methodology for building and enhancing products. Instead of following a fixed plan, it emphasizes collaboration among cross-functional teams, rapid development, and constant feedback. Products are developed in small, manageable increments, which enables teams to respond to changing market conditions and customer needs effectively. It's a customer-centric approach that promotes innovation and delivers value quickly, making it a valuable strategy in today's dynamic business environment.  

Digitally Native: A digitally native employee, often referred to as a "digital native," is an individual who has grown up in an environment where digital technology and the internet have been pervasive from a young age. This term is often associated with generational cohorts such as Millennials (born approximately 1981-1996) and Generation Z (born approximately 1997 and later) but can apply to anyone who has had extensive exposure to digital technology from childhood.  The characteristics of digital native employees are; tech-savvy, digital communication skills, adaptable, quick-learners, online collaborators, digitally creative, information gathering, mobile technology reliance, data privacy awareness, connectivity expectations, social media engaged, digital native mindset.

Experience: Today people expect a seamless and easy experience when booking holidays, ordering groceries and doing their banking.  This same experience is expected in the work environment.  

IT: Information Technology

OODA Loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act: The OODA loop is a four-step approach developed by military strategist John Boyd. Who Use OODA Loop? This looping concept referred to the ability possessed by fighter pilots that allowed them to succeed in combat

Words Which Could/Should Be Used

agile, adaptable

growth mindset, mind-shfit, design services (think about human services)

confidence, relevance, excellence
