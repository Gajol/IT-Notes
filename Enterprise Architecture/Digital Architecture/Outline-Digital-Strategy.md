Sept 25 Marc, Dave, Doug

- RIO - Research Innovation Office (2 FTE)
- Is this Digital Strategy & IT Plan? Marc?
- Pillars Theme on a G. (Graphic)
- Drivers: Use GAcs
- "We have DEBT & OP Model Changes: Pillars:  Foundation "in order to do other 3 - services, workplace, workforce - we need a foundation".  ADT "when I do shared infrastructure its to enable other 3".  Ops changes (D**, M***, P***)
- ICA / RPOF - CDS (diodes) in/out
- reorg:
  - ODP: reorg to do platform, 
  - ITSS cloud section, 
  - BSD DevOps
- LCA slide local -> enterprise
- pre-meeting : doug's notes:
  - wish-list vs prioritized goals (rumelt good/bad strategy)
  - drivers/pain points and focus
  - need to push workloads to low classification zones, risk is silo'd data and employee frustration as processes span environments
  - collaboration: engaged workforce, risk: collaboration leads to ...
  - EA: write success story for 3, 6, 12 months
  - 5EE sharing (bilateral)

Dorin: Strategic direction should not be restricted by current capacity.  

EA Team / OCIO Concerns: 

- Digital: Not just tech.  The I**C problem (need digital-staff comfortable with using technology)
- Cloud: It just branches (shadow IT at scale) - it gets silo'd, "is it digital, for sure it is EA/CIO realm" - social what we think works best
- EA Tools: Need good communication skills and tools to support communication.  Avolution Abicus, EA Sparc, c4panel, ...  What do we have? Where are we going? Diagramming?  What EA services do we provide?

Dan: Cyber budget askes

Dale: CSE, 5-years ago, two systems (workloads move to LS) 

Tech Drivers: AI/ML, big data, analytics, IoT, 5G, 6G, Edge, cloud, robotics, quantum, cryptocurrency, 

Does Strategy Answer:

- What has to happen for the goal to be realized?  What key strength is being built?  A change in industry is a new opportunity (OSINT, Cloud, Data, AI/ML, ...)

Rumelt Good Strategy vs Blue Strategy

| Good Strategy                                                | Blue Sky Strategy                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Define Challenge                                             | Restates desired state of affairs                            |
| Bridge Challenge & Action                                    | Ignores how to get there (how to get to desired state)       |
| Bridges direct & immediate objectives (within grasp), given existing resources & competence.  Proximate objectives: a state of affairs close enought at hand to be feasible.  Clear and feasible objective. | Blue sky strategic objectives, result in little achievement. |
| Strategy addresses a specific process or accomplishment.  Finds the most promising opportunities for the business.  A short list of things to do. |                                                              |
| Includes choice, sets some things aside (might impact some interest groups more); psychologic, political and organizational work included in change management. |                                                              |
