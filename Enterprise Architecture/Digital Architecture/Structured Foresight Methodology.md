# Structured Foresight Methodology

Structured foresight methodology is a systematic approach to anticipating future scenarios, trends, and possibilities. It involves using a range of tools and techniques to identify and analyze potential futures, and to develop strategies to respond to them.

The methodology typically involves several key steps:

1. **Scanning** **and** **analysis:** Gather and analyze data on current trends, developments, and potential disruptors to identify drivers of change that may shape the future.
2. **Developing** **scenarios:** Use scenarios to explore a range of possible futures and the implications for the organization or system being studied.
3. **Identifying** **indicators:** Identify indicators that could signal the emergence of particular futures, enabling early detection and response.
4. **Strategy** **development:** Develop strategies to respond to different future scenarios and to position the organization or system to thrive in a range of possible futures.
5. **Monitoring** **and** **adaptation:** Monitor changes in the external environment and adapt strategies as necessary to respond to emerging trends and developments.

Structured foresight methodology provides a framework for organizations and individuals to think critically about the future and to develop strategies to navigate uncertainty and complexity. By considering multiple possible futures, it enables more informed decision-making and planning, and can help organizations to build resilience and agility in the face of change.
