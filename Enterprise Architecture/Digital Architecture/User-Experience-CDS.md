# User Experience at CDS

# CDS - Canada Digital Service

CDS is leading the way GC delivers service.  CDS is a human-centric design organization.  CDS uses the skills and expertise of the creation process including service design, content design and interaction design.  Leveraging this abilities allows CDS to measurably improve the experience and outcomes for people using services (reference [CDS Human-centred design](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/topic/design))

## Designer Toolkit

[CDS's toolkit](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/resource/equipping-designers) is a standard product management suite leverage the latest cloud offerings:

- Figma: collaborative design, wireframing and prototyping
- Miro: Visual collaboration and mapping
- Trello: Planning and managing backlogs, roadmaps and Kanban process[^Trello]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): Organizing ideas in writing documentation (wikis, knowledge base, roadmap, docs, projects).  Atlassian Confluence's competition (reference [Confluence's view of Notion](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/comparison/confluence-vs-notion))
- AirTable: data collection, tagging and analysis spreadsheets with API (Excel++)
- [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/): Collecting and analysing insights:  User research backed by data.
- [EasyRetro](https://easyretro.io/): Collecting inputs and running retrospectives 
- Slack: team collaboration
- Google Suite: document storage and collaborative authoring
- GitHub: software code repository 

# User Experience Research / UX Research

[UX research](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/topic/ux-research) research helps build services that meet human needs. UX or design research helps us understand the people who use our services. If we understand them, we can better meet their needs. Interviews, observations, and usability testing are all types of design research.

- UX research is not the same as government consolations, business requirements and public opinion research

CDS has an internal design research handbook.  Some of the content is shared publicly, including:

## Research Interviewing

[Research interview](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/resource/research-interviewing) is asking people a series of questions and asking for their response. 

- productive questions: ask about sequence, quantity, specific examples, complete list, relationships, organizational structure.
- probing questions: ask for clarification, code words / native language, emotional cues, why, emotional areas, without presuming, explain to an outsider/9-year old, teach another
- build rapport and trust: ask questions and stop (listen), maintain eye contact and open body language, show you are listening, ask follow-up questions, reference earlier statements
  - be careful of body language; avoid nodding, and sounds like "mmm-hmm".   Balance encouraging participant with perception you are judging statements
  - be selective about talking about yourself.  Empathy is about listening.
  - avoid interrupting.  Embrace the silence.
- manage the flow in an interview and its phases
  - phases: warming up ðŸ ¢ establish the basics ðŸ ¢ diving deeper ðŸ ¢ key questions ðŸ ¢ summing up ðŸ ¢ relfecting and verifying
  - say when you are changing topics.  Let participants know the goal for the session
  - give people an out if they are feeling uncomfortable
  - give people a chance to ask their own questions
- more than just questions: ask people to complete tasks (observe), get reactions, sketch websites, sequence cards to represent their experience, write down key points, watch them complete a task
- look for patterns, not outliers

Inquiry is the key to transformation. In a complex system, answers have short shelf-lives, but good questions serve you forever. Questions help you see a wicked challenge clearly, understand it from a new perspective, and find surprising options for transformative action.

## Usability Testing

[Usability testing](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/resource/usability-testing) is asking people to complete tasks and observing what happens.

- make a plan (purpose, participlants and tasks)
- recruit enough people: at least five (5); there is no industry norm, but 5 is the minimum
- choose tasks people would actually complete
- quietly observe
- look for patterns across participants

## Product Lifecycle and Design Research

CDS follows the phases of an agile product (discover, alpha, beta, live and retire - [reference Agile Delivery - gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)). [CDS Reference](https://resources.alpha.canada.ca/resource/design-researcher-activities)

[^Discovery]: Before you commit to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved. hat means learning about; 1) your users and what theyâ€™re trying to achieve, 2) any constraints youâ€™d face making changes to how the service is run - for example because of technology or legislation, 3) the underlying policy intent youâ€™ve been set up to address - this is the thing that government wants to change or make happen, 4) opportunities to improve things - by sharing data with other teams.   This part of your project is called the discovery phase. What you learn during discovery should help you work out whether you want to move forward to the alpha phase. Running an alpha means youâ€™ve decided that the benefits of looking further into the problem outweigh the cost. You should not start building your service in discovery. Discovery team = {User researcher, product management / service owner, designer, optional - content designer, optional - developer} [[GOV-UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)] [[GOV AU](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/resources/plan-a-project/phases-of-agile-delivery)].
[^Alpha]: Alpha is where you try out different solutions to the problems you learnt about during discovery. Spend alpha building prototypes and testing different ideas. And do not be afraid to challenge the way things are done at the moment: alpha is a chance to explore new approaches. You do not have to prototype the userâ€™s entire wider journey.  A crucial part of alpha is [identifying your riskiest assumptions and testing them](https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/what-is-riskiest-assumption-test). What these are will depend on the service youâ€™re building. [[GOV-UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works)]
[^Beta]: Beta is where you take the best ideas from Alpha and build it. During beta, focus on making sure that the solution youâ€™ve chosen works as well as possible by carrying out [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-beta) and starting to gather data on [how successful the service is](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success) based on the success metrics you identified in alpha. Iterate the service based on what you learn.  In terms of development (software) you need to consider all the common software responsivities; CI/CD, security, testing, performance, ... [[GOV UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works)]
[^Live]: The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way. Improvements are identified with user research, tested for quality, browser compatibility, and tested for accessibility. Product management approaches will review and revise performance metrics, service levels, penetration & vulnerability testing, inclusivity.  [[GOV-UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works)]
[^Trello]: Compared to Atlassian's Jira, Trello is, hands down, the go-to tool for businesses that need a general-use project management software package. [[reference Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/trello-vs-jira/)]
