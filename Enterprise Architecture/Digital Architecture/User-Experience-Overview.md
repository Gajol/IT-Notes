# User Experience

User experience (UX) focuses on having **a deep understanding of users**, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations. All while taking business goals and objectives into account. People realized that this mindset and practice can be adopted across every business function, and ultimately a business’ mission and vision.

The  user experience designer makes people lives easier through designing better websites, web applications, mobile experiences, and even voice interfaces.
