# User Experience

User experience (UX) focuses on having **a deep understanding of users**, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations. All while taking business goals and objectives into account. People realized that this mindset and practice can be adopted across every business function, and ultimately a business’ mission and vision.

The  user experience designer makes people lives easier through designing better websites, web applications, mobile experiences, and even voice interfaces.

## User Research: 

Strategic UX Research, conversely, is about attaining a deeper understanding of all the different users and their individual experiences. Everyone learns more about what makes an excellent experience for users and customers and where the experience could be better.

These experiences go beyond just using the organization’s products or services. It includes what happens leading up to their use, between uses, and after the person has interacted with the product. Strategic UX Research learns the entirety of the experiences people have.

Research teams orchestrate *deep hanging-out* sessions with customers and users. They collect observations and insights that show what a day in the life of users could be. They combine different experiences with the product or service across the user’s lifetime. They connect this all together to show a detailed journey.
