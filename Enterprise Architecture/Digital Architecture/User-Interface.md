# User Interface Design

Rules of Interface Design

**Shneiderman Golden Rules Of Interface Design**

1. Strive for Consistency
2. Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts
3. Offer Informative Feedback
4. Design Dialogue to Yield Closure
5. Prevent Error / Offer Simple Error Handling
6. Permit Easy Reversal of Actions
7. Support Internal Locus of Control: Users initiate actions (not respond) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control))
8. Reduce Short-Term Memory Load

## Research Methods for HCI

From [Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction](https://worldcat.org/en/title/985364166)

Seven types of research contributions for HCI (from [Wodbrokc and Kientz - 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2907069))

1. empirical: qualitative and quantitative data collected through experimental deissgn, surveys, focus groups, time diaries, sensors (automation)
2. artifact: design and development of new artifacts (interfaces, toolkits, architectures, mock-ups).  HCI prototypes
3. methodical: new approaches that influence processes in research or practice
4. theoretical: concepts and models that are vehicles for though
5. dataset: a corpus for the benefit of the research community
6. survey: a review and synthesis of work done in an area
7. opinion: writings which seek to persuade the readers to change their minds

## HCI Findings 

Menu design:  broad, shallow tree structure is preferred

# Definitions

**Locus of control** is the degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces (beyond their influence), have control over the outcome of events in their lives. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control))
