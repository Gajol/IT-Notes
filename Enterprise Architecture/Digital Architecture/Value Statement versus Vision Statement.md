Take 2: Public Safety Digital Strategy







A value proposition for a digital strategy could be something like "Increase efficiency and reduce costs through the use of digital tools." This value proposition clearly states the benefits of a digital strategy, and how it can add value to a business. It also highlights the efficiency and cost-saving aspects of a digital strategy, which are two key priorities for many businesses. In addition, it is relevant to many different industries and business models, making it a good general-purpose value proposition for digital strategies. Of course, a more specific value proposition would be tailored to the specific needs and goals of a particular business.

## Value Statement versus Vision Statement

The main difference between a value proposition and a vision statement is that a value proposition is more focused on the specific benefits and outcomes of a product or service, while a vision statement is more about the overall purpose and direction of a company. A value proposition is more tangible and measurable, while a vision statement is more about inspiring and motivating people to achieve a common goal. A value proposition can be thought of as the "what" and the "why" of a business, while a vision statement is more about the "how" and the "where" of a business.
