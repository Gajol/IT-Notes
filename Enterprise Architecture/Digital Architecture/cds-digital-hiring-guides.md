[^MVP]: [reference [clutch.co RAT vs MVP difference](https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/what-is-riskiest-assumption-test)]. The Riskiest Assumption Test is here, and it’s becoming a much better way to prove your product’s viability to your users.  The Riskiest Assumption Test can determine whether consumers have an interest in the product before developing anything.
