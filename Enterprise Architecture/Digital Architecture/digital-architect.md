# Why Digital Architect

## Microsoft

> "Digital technology is going to become core to the future of sustainable and resilient businesses." — Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft
>
> Computing is transcending beyond knowledge work to help people who are on the construction site, in care management in hospitals, on manufacturing shop flows.  
>
> “STEM is going to be important, but it’s not like we need everybody to have a masters in computer science to be employed, because that would be a massive failure of our labour market policies,  The goal here is to in fact go the other way, which is — can I take the expertise and democratize it to help productivity gains of a frontline worker? That’s the problem to solve.” — Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft 2020
>
> "Time in an attention economy is the only scarce commodity."  — Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft  (Attention Economics - Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon "Attention is the bottleneck of human thought")

## McKinsey

> "Enterprise architecture (EA) are changing rapidly as the importance of technology is driving business value increases." — McKinsey 2021.  Digital failures affect the entire business.

Technology, computing and software engineering are easy, people are tough.   Digital Architects help bridge the business with the technology professionals.

- How is a digital architect different from a Business Analyst, Business Architect?
  - None, it depends on the roles, skills and experience of the person and the roles and responsibilities they play in an organization.  [[McKinsey - How Enterprise Architects need to evolve to survive in a digital world](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-enterprise-architects-need-to-evolve-to-survive-in-a-digital-world)]
  - Evolution:  In the past, business architects distanced themselves from technology ([reference](https://www.bainstitute.org/resources/articles/digital-business-architect-lessons-field)).  This was largely because technology a key enabler of business.   In the past 0 years (2013+) technology has influenced business dramatically, and, necessitated business transformation. ([McKinsey - 2013 How digital transformation drives business value](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/finding-your-digital-sweet-spot))

- What led to digital transformation?  [2016 McKinsey - Industries Disrupted by Digital](https://hbr.org/2016/03/the-industries-that-are-being-disrupted-the-most-by-digital)  and [202 Investopia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020615/20-industries-threatened-tech-disruption.asp).

- start-up culture, has digital natives, with practices that do not include architects.  Startup culture, often does not have time for architecture purity (complexity, evolving quality versus designed at the outset, monolithic, not composable, not observalbe, waits for growth to be able to invest in stabiliy, ...)
  - results in [technical debt](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-debt-reclaiming-tech-equity) increase, few service re-use
  - an EA's contribution to digital should lead in outcomes like increased number of services and reuse of services (composable systems, API first approach, ...)

- Problem Definition:  What problem are we trying to solve

# Enterprise Architecture

**Modelling**: Model what is needed to change: operating model, map business capabilities, align technoloyg to organization strategic goals.

Integrated strategic planning solutions:

This means the solutions (business and technology initiatives) and their archtected solutions are aligned with enterprise strategies.   Examples:

- solution architected to be secure, private, accessible at outset (shift-left quality attributes)
- solution aligned with domain architect strategies, key business changes/pressures (big data, ), (cyber, need to share, need for dissemination control, ..)
- digitalization and data alignment: 
- digitization and standards alignment
- **concern / awareness**:   The idea that an enterprise architect creates a solution contradicts the principals from digital standards to collaborate widely and iteratively.  The enterprise architect owns the generation of the EA artefacts, but in contemporary times must do this with an agile, collaborative, inclusive approach.

## EA Changing Landscape

[[McKinsey - How Enterprise Architects need to evolve to survive in a digital world - 2021](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-enterprise-architects-need-to-evolve-to-survive-in-a-digital-world)] see [McKinsey's Digital Enterprise Architecture and Digital Platforms](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-enterprise-architects-need-to-evolve-to-survive-in-a-digital-world#/) page.

### Goal Setting: Expand EA Objectives

- The importance of technology driving business value is increasing.  This leads to rapid changes in the objectives and demands of enterprise architecture.

- Enable Strategic Decisions: EA's tasked with setting strategic direction.  Digital initiatives are key to business success.   Unlike the past, digital failures affect the entire business.    EA decisions:

  - where to have shared solutions across partners, business units:  affects business model and operating model.
  - EA figure out (design, architect) a solution that can enable the company's plan for the future.

- Ensure Reusability:  Architects facilitate the discussion between product teams around features and solutions.   Working in the open to enable easy discovery of features available for reuse and ensuring close alignment to strategy.

- Enable Development Speed: Manage a consistent technology stack, ready-to-use platform for new development teams (developer experience).   Technology components to develop, deploy and test new functionality (DevOps) and a curated set of "patterns", best practices to store data, integration with other technology/teams, and perform common tasks.   Without this environment, framework, guidance the flexibility and responsiveness of a digital business is severally hampered.

### Changes: Practical Changes to Enterprise Architect's Role

- Pragmatic communicator:  The ability fo enterprise architects to talk to executive management is key (the leadership board).  This implications of technology decisions are key.    In that past, enterprise architects where a business-to-technology translator.  EA's translated business requirements to technology solutions, and, negotiated IT system components and procurement.  Today, as digital technology is key to business success, the EA must be able to communicate upwards to business leaders.  Business knowledge is essential.  Communicate the impacts of ERP investments, mergers, integrations, partnerships.
  - Beyond PowerPoint drawings.  EA's must use practical business language to communicate the return on investment (ROI) of architecture decisions, and, how the contribute to the business-outcome key performance indicators (KPI).  EA's must communicate at the CXO level. 

#### Think Like an Engineer

Many architects are unhelpful in the Agile and DevOps world.  

- their coding knowledge is outdated, or, based on theoretical understanding of IT issues resulting in their advice and recommendations are often wrong

Architects must think and operate more like engineers:

- need to be able to speak credibly with operational engineers.  For example, how to decommission a system to reduce technical debt
- need to know how to change code to achieve the desired outcome
- change the mindset that "getting your hands dirty" is beneath them
- architects must be fluent in both business and IT areas; or at least an expert in one, and proficient in the other

#### Coach

Shift from enforcement, gating and "no" based on IT rules and guidelines.  

- integrate rules and guidelines into the deployment mechanism (DevOps).  Developer should receive feedback and suggestions for good practices in a timely, helpful manner.
- customer-oriented mindset by supporting colleagues (business and developers) in finding solutions for what they want to achieve.  
- EA provide relevant documentation, training support and clearly defined integration and data products that are reusable by all teams.

### CIO: Practical  CIO Steps to Modernize EA's Role and Function

EA must change with their function in light of fast, changing technology forces.  The change must be managed to avoid chaos, but the changes also be practicl.

- **clear accountabilities**: Who is accountable for EA objectives?  CIO should identify who is accountable.  Put in place a few strict rules.  For example, all inter-team communication must be service-based (API first approach).  For example, a DB-stored-procedure, shared-drive file-watch approach is not permitted.
- **architect mindset maturity**: Everyone is an architect or thinks like an architect in a digital-native company.  Educate, train and provide experience opportunities for the entire company on why good architecture is important and how it can impact the business.  Clarify to organization impacts of poorly integrated architecture (online store user experience impacts due to responsiveness issues, ...) or the impact to the top-line[^topline] due to a root-cause-analysis problem.
- **soft skills**: Architecture teams often lack soft skills which are key in collaborating and communicating with stakeholders, change management and executives.  Architects often have deep analytical skills and experience developing sophisticated frameworks.  These need to be complimented with soft skills.  Interpersonal skills and problem solving skills are important skills to develop for enterprise architects.
  - reduce: move away from PowerPoints and the emphasis on structure and systems.
  - increase: focus on understanding the language of the business scenarios, profit & loss impact, ROI, risk, trade-offs, etc.  These skills require dedicated training and capability-building programs.  A great commitment to partner with the business is required.
- **recruit talent**: find new enterprise architects: accelerate change by hiring outside talent.  Architects are attracted to interesting problems and making a difference.
  - raise the profile: Motivation for top talent is driven by a meaningful role and decision rights to effect the necessary change.  This is a bigger motivator than compensation.

### Digital Consultations: 2018

[2018 - Digital Consultations](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/national-digital-data-consultations/en)

> "We have an opportunity to build a digital legacy for Canada to become a global innovation leaders.  However, to spur digital innovation, investment and job creation in Canada, citizens must have trust and confidence that their data and privacy will be protected.  The national consultation is a first step in making this vision a reality." — Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development

[Leadership Opportunities in Digital Age](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/national-digital-data-consultations/en/results/digital-and-data-roundtable-summary-september-21-2018-san-francisco-usa)

Key Opportunities, Considerations and Challenges:

- **Executive Leadership**:  Digital is not just a technology focus.  Need executive, C-suite and sales, talent.  Canada unable to attract executive talent with completive pay.   Canada must create entrepreneurs and leaders, while building our tech and STEM capacity.
- **proactive plan**:  forecast what industries are being disrupted and get ahead of disruption (finance, government and health care are industries that have yet to be disrupted)
- **education**: risk-adverse mindset is a long-term challenge.  Mindset is developed early and requires long-term investment
- **Immigration**: expand and improve on pilot programs to bring top talent to Canada for companies to re-locate.
- **Universities**: build strength in a few key areas through universities.  Canada is top global talent in AI due to early investments.   Canada struggling to retain top talent due to pay inequity of other countries.  Long term focus required.  Identify other areas that will be transformative in the future.
- **Investment**: Create incentives for investors and companies that are likely to create signifant value.  Think beyond credits or tax cuts.
- **Collaborate** (do not compete): Our strength is coming together as a collective.  Canada is not large as a country.  Gain strength by work together across all sections (industry, academia, government, ...)

Ideas and Outcomes

- Define Success: Set targets around market leadership.  Are we producing and attracting market leaders and supporting them to remain leaders.   Forward looking measures of success.  Do we have noted scientific researchers.  Change attitude (mindset) to "how do we win" from "how do we not lose".  Hold a "top idea" competition.  Look beyond USA as the only comparator to success; Israel.
- Funding Mechanisms: Create learning opportunities for Canadian angel investors and investors to learn from international investors.  Set foreign investment targets; active engage foreign investments.  Spend time in other places to create networks and expand mindset.
- Promote Company Growth, Attract Companies:  Be more welcoming to foreign-founded start-ups.  Incentives for start-ups to be silicon valley with a Canadian city workforce (Vnacouver).  Create programs to promote business in Canaada.  Engage expats more creatively; think beyond conversations and receptions.
- Technology Adoption: Encourage entrepreneurial mindset training earlie in education.  Fund curriculum to include entrepreneurial aspects.
- Diverse Education: Teach technology trends early (Estonia includes coding in early education).
- Responsive Immigration System: Have VISA for entrepreneur talent (currently they must drop their ventures)
- Global Talent: Identify Canadian technology leadership areas in emerging science (machine learning, virtual reality, augmented reality and machine imager - computer vision, material science).  Provide incentives for universities to attract this talent.  
- Fund Universities: Train students in commercialization.  Educate on intellectual property.
- Incubators: Setup in cities.
- Private Sector, provincial and municipal Incentives
- Attract and Build Talent: Create parallel programs for non-technology streams; sales (at business schools)

### A Learning Nation

Report: [A Learning Nation](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/future-skills/report-learning-nation.html) 2022-04

Introduction:

- Disruptive global change can mean opportunities for Canadians: We live in a complex global environment characterized by rapid technological innovation, climate change and unforeseen events. Unanticipated and unprecedented changes require us to adapt quickly, to think and do things differently, and to be nimble and responsive.  As tasks change, jobs require more and different skills than in years past.

- Canada and Canadians can succeed by taking action now: Moving forward, every sector in Canada has a role to play – no single organization or institution has all the solutions and we must work together across all sectors to succeed and to ensure all benefit.

Priorities & Recommendations

Priority 1: Provide access to relevant, reliable and timely labour market information and tools so that all Canadians can make informed learning and training decisions

- Leverage innovative technologies to ensure all Canadians can access and navigate learning and training options. 

  - **Automate personalized training plans**: Leverage innovative technologies to create a platform that makes it easier for individuals to generate personalized training plans that link jobs and skills profiles to training options and related supports.

- Produce quality information on the skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow.   

  - **Increase skills focus in collection, analysis and dissemination of labour market information (LMI):** Leverage leading-edge technologies to generate LMI that has a greater emphasis on skills profiles related to new and emerging job opportunities. 

    **Strengthen stakeholder engagement in LMI design and production:** Encourage and support greater participation of industry, employers, career counselling professionals and labour in clarifying evolving information needs and emerging skills requirements. 

    **Establish a common framework for transferable skills:** Governments, working with all sectors, could lead efforts to establish a framework to name, define and promote the skills people need to seize emerging opportunities across most occupations and sectors (for example, problem solving, communication, etc.). Collaboration amongst governments could be supported through the Forum of Labour Market Ministers.

- Disseminate skills information to those who develop and provide training and advice to Canadians. 

  - **Enable Canadians to make informed skills related decisions:** Leverage innovative technologies to create accessible information resources for jobseekers, workers, employers, career counselling professionals and government officials to make informed decisions about careers, skills acquisition, workforce development and economic development.
  - **Improve dissemination of labour market information:** Increase focus on disseminating relevant, timely and accessible LMI, particularly skills information, to education, training and counselling providers.
  - **Create content tailored to different audiences:** Translate LMI into easy to use products that are value-added for different groups (for example, students, job seekers, education and training providers, employment counselors, employers, parents, etc.).

Priority 2: Promote, enable and support learning throughout Canadians’ lives, in particular by removing structural and systemic barriers to participation

- Improve targeted supports for under-represented groups to develop skills needed to succeed

  - **Apply user-centred design:** Design employment and skills development programs, services and supports to address the distinct barriers and circumstances of under-represented groups.
  - **Focus on promising job prospects**: Support workers and jobseekers to develop the skills needed for the work most likely to be in demand and support transitions into new opportunities.
  - **Replicate best practices**: Incorporate targeted skills development approaches for distinct groups (for example, persons with disabilities, newcomers, etc.) into onboarding new recruits, talent management and succession planning.
  - **Take an enterprise-wide approach to inclusion**: Diversity in workforce recruitment, retention and development starts with commitment to active inclusion and engagement of everyone in all business practices.

- Remove structural and systemic barriers to skills development to set up Canadians to succeed in the future economy

  - **Modernize work-focused programs**: For individuals with limited income security, provide “wrap-around supports” (for example, housing allowance, childcare, etc.) along with employment and skills programming.

  - **Address geographic barriers**: Ensure that every Canadian has access to high-speed internet and reliable telecommunications on the fastest timetable possible.

- Create enabling conditions for individuals to take control of their own learning

  - **Modernize labour legislation to support lifelong learning**: The federal government could work with interested provinces and territories, as well as business and labour organizations, to establish a consistent framework of standards for how individuals can take time from work to participate in training and other skills development activities.
  - **Use broader range of fiscal tools to support training and skills development**: Increase tax deductions, tuition rebates and other forms of funding to reduce up-front financial barriers. Focus on helping Canadians with lower incomes and those in more precarious work situations.

Priority 3: Enable First Nation, Inuit and Métis learning and skills development based on a commitment to reconciliation and self-determination

- Reinforce First Nation, Inuit and Métis peoples’ approaches for designing, replicating and scaling culturally appropriate practices into skills development and learning programs for individuals and for businesses
  - **Embrace the philosophy of “nothing about us without us”***:* Ensure Indigenous Peoples, governments and organizations are at the centre of designing, developing and implementing culturally appropriate supports to strengthen success in post-secondary programs and certifications.
  - **Provide mentorships for post-secondary and secondary level students**: Ensure that Indigenous students have access to mentorship resources to help them navigate challenges and celebrate successes.

# Digital Transformation

2013

[McKinsey 2013 How Digital Transformation Drives Business Value](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/finding-your-digital-sweet-spot)

Digital can reshape every aspect of the modern enterprise:

- customer experience
- product and service innovation
- distribution of marketing and sales
- digital fulfilment
- risk optimization
- enhanced corporate control
- decision making, connectivity, automation, innovation

Investments should be proportional to value at stake

- estimate the value at stake
- prioritize
- take an end-to-end view: include processes to support digitization
- align business portfolio: transformation will destroy some lines-of-business (**shreddies**).  Divest where it makes sense.

# Questions

## HR Strategy

Are we producing and attracking market leaders and supporting them to remain leaders.

- market leaders: intelligence leaders, exploitation leaders, ...
- supporting them: employee journey

General

- Do you think ...
- That would be a nice thing to know.

Disagreements: People are possessive of their ideas and will defend and favour their idea even if your idea is better.

1. Make it collaborative.   I don't think it is going to work.   What if we try.  This opens it up...
2. Acknowledge them and add to it.  I think you are right to bring up this topic.  And what I would do / like to add is X Y and Z
3. Buy into the conversation.   I had some thoughts on this topic.  Do you mind if I share them.  Looking for 'No'.  No is much easier than a yes.

## Economics

[Attention Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy): Humans have limited cognitive resources that can be used at any given time, when resources are allocated to one task, the resources available for other tasks will be limited. Given that attention is a cognitive process that involves the selective concentration of resources on a given item of information, to the exclusion of other perceivable information, attention can be considered in terms of limited processing resources.  

- Thoughts: Traditional change management practices rely on waterfall concepts like ADKAR (awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement).  Successful change must capture audiences attention similar to advertising.  Advertising advanced with attention economics theory.  In the past advertisers used a linear waterfall process: AIDA (attention, interest, design and action).  

## Behavioural Economics

Creating Behaviour Change ([Coursera 10-hour course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/behavioral-change))

[classical conditioning](https://www.verywellhealth.com/classical-conditioning-5218361): A person can learn in both conscious and unconscious ways. Behaviours, attitudes, ideas, and the absorption of new information can be learned with or without a person’s knowledge.  Classical conditioning is a form of unconscious learning that was popularized by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist. The results of this discovery led Pavlov to develop the theory that behaviour could be learned simply by introducing consistent stimuli.

- **Pavlov's Theory**: The results of this discovery led Pavlov to develop the theory that behaviour could be learned simply by introducing consistent stimuli.  The Pavlovian Impact: Classical conditioning is often considered the <u>most important discovery</u> in the history of [psychology](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-psychology-5189490), because it forms the basis of behavioural psychology. It can be used in a variety of different ways, from helping people with mental health disorders to keeping domestic livestock safe from ravenous coyotes.  Because of Pavlov's findings on classical conditioning, the process is also sometimes called Pavlovian conditioning.    Classical condition principles are helpful in treating anxiety, depression, phobias, panic disorder, substance use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder.

[operant conditioning](https://www.verywellhealth.com/operant-conditioning-to-change-behaviors-5214674): Operant conditioning is a process in which people learn to behave in a certain way in order to get rewards and avoid punishment. It's a type of behavior change that occurs because of a purposeful cause-and-effect reinforcement. When applied in behavioral therapy, operant conditioning can be used to create change based on rewards and punishments.
