## Digital Strategy Presentation

- who is audience
- what is goal:  so they understand why this is important to do
- what is goal: so they buy-into concept
- iterate presentation (glen, jenzy, andrew, stephen, EA team, ...)

## Digital Concepts & Themes

- problem solving: "Problem solving's key role is to do ____ because ____".  Solve the right problem.

- Ux

- Trust

- Product Management: discovery, alpha, beta, ship

- Service Design: double-diamond: ideate

- risk-based approach: risk-appetite versus risk-averse culture

- culture

- sustainability: climate

- transparent

- human-centric services and design

- behavioural flexibility (mentioned by Stephen Lee), open mindset, fail forward.  Understand why this is important to do.

- digital story: onboarding:  more than just when the employee has a space, desktop and credentials.  What could we measure that relates to the human-experience of coming into our organization?  Time to feel at home, success rate of employees feeling at home quickly.

- CSE principles (from 2021 HR or SAIS design)

  - Ux is paramount
  - Data Quality is a continued priority
  - System Integrations drives automation & reduces costs
  - Legacy processes need to be challenged & modernized ( example at our department is the redefining process from 44-steps to 32-steps)

- Amazon 19-principles

- Straw-man Argument: where a debater does not engage in the argument, or, with the actual points being made, but with a complete different point of view.  Imagine arguiung against an imaginary scarecrow.  

  > A straw man argument, sometimes called a straw person argument or spelled strawman argument, is the [logical fallacy](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/logical-fallacies/) of distorting an opposing position into an extreme version of itself and then arguing against that extreme version. In creating a straw man argument, the arguer strips the opposing point of view of any nuance and often misrepresents it in a negative light. â€” [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/straw-man-fallacy/)

## Pens Research - Notes from September, 2023

- Goal was to find good Parker G2 refils, and, own some classic Parker G2 style pens

- Pens

  - Park Urban BP

  - JetStream RT

  - Ballograf Epoca P (Swedish Parker equivalent)

  - Faber Castell Hexo Twist (bought from Chapters - and cheap, broke - returned)

  - Ohto Flash Dry Pen - check it is Parker G2 compatible

  - Ohto Horizon Blue

  - Leuchtturm 1917 Drehgriffel

  - Faber Castel model ?


  Good Pens - not Parker G2

  - Zebra Sarasa Grande. I believe these also take the Engergel refil

- Refils - Parker G2

  - [Penvibe Parker G2 - ISO 12757](https://penvibe.com/the-ultimate-parker-style-g2-refill-buyers-guide)
  - Ohto PG-105NP Flash Dry Gel & Ohto Horizon Gel ($22)
  - Rotring Rapid Pro (Plastic)
  - Parker Quink Gel Refill - really like it
    - QuinkFlow - versatility, writes on lots of different paper, ballpoint and therefore oil-based, lots of resistence
    - Quink Gel: Good wirting, better definition, bold blue

  - Fisher space pen w/G2 adapter, lasts forever (great in-the-car pen)
  - Viscout Smarttouch, expensive, but good
  - Uni-ball Jet Stream Gel : SXR-600-05 (or 07) - Parker G2 style
  - Schneider Gelion+: gel, does not write on smooth paper, dries fast


### Weighing my pens

- Pelikan 25g (I love it)
- Skage 45g - seems heavy, and the tapered tube makes it tiring to write with
- big-i-design #1 - 37g
- big-i-design #2 - 33g

### Not Parker G2

  - Lamy 2000 roller - water based ink, smooth, but bleeds

  - Lamy 2000 roller - thick oil ink

    - Lamy 201//2075 - 1996 iconic, fiberglass, tapered, light, clicky.  M16 refil is proprietary (MED / FINE)

    - Lamy Rollerball is larger

  - Lamy Studio Lx Roller Ball $56

  - Zebra F-701 (narrow), Zebra X-701 rugged

  - Zebra Blen (designed in 2018 by Japan Nendo design firm) - takes Zebra EQ Refil - emulsion ink

    - Zebra Fortia EM, Fortia Cone, Surari 300 (all use same refil Zebra EQ)
