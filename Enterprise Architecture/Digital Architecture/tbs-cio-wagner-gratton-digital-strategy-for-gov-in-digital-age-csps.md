Digital - Its not about technoloyg.
Cloud First:  Not cloud for everything.  Cloud is an operating model, not a technooloyg.  It is a way to think about how you deliver services in a way that is composable that can shift with your business model.  Security reasons might be a reason for things to not be in the cloud. 

Pivoting to service. 

GG Mary Simon Speech from Throne 2021 Call to Public Servants : "The decade is still young. With compassion, courage, and determination, we have the power to make it better than how it started. That can only happen by standing together.  Never before has so much depended on your ability to deliver results for Canadians."  

Doing Government in a Digital Age. Strategy for Government in the Digital Age
conditions for success, expecations. Really about trust. foundations for democracy 

> "A digital transformation could do so much more than provide digital service an dmake happy clients.  It could decrease inequality, create balance, and build our ambition for Canada" — Provincial CIO

> Luigi Zingales, Economist at University of Chicago, Founder of Financial Times Index: "Government has a unique opportunity to engender trust in people. The government's role is to allow people to trust, so that they can worry about doing everything else in their life without feeling insecurity.  It takes generations to build that."

if we're talking about creating trust for citizens, creating a foundation for democracy:
- think about accessibility
- think about accessibility
- think about privacy and security
- think about delivery of services
- think about giving tech briefings to a number of MPs around digital ID (as an example). That's one where that whole concept of trust, privacy and security converge.  When we talk about an individual's digital credentials, and what that can unlock for them from a service perspective.
- start with thinking about the problem from the citizen's perspective 

Trust
> So, in thinking about doing government in a digital age, we started to think about what are the conditions for success and what are the expectations that citizens have? And it's really around creating the conditions for trust for our citizens.

> So, even just seeing this, probably 10 years ago, five years ago, we would never see a digital ambition, digital strategy, a digital plan, starting with something as profound as that. But thinking about designing systems, designing services that serve Canadians, that serve Canadian businesses, and people that are coming to Canada, it's about trust.


Past, focused on technology. 
- until recently CIO's were also CTO's.  Their focus was on keeping the systems running.
- SSC freed up CIO's to focus on service, focus on data.  The technology elements (the technology stack) was being managed by SSC.   - unique value proposition within GC that digital leaders should take advantage of.  Conversations on the service-side and not the technology side).

	- (**Shared Infrastructure**), **PaaS** for EDE, OSIC**
	
> "Technological advancement isn't just about building better human machine interfaces.  It's really not about the technology at all, actually, it's about humans first.  It is about being better humans and helping humans." - Rana El Khaloubi - Emotional AI Pioneer

Westminster System : A lot of vertical accountability.  Programs and Services you have to deliver.
- to change the mechanisms that we have underneath the Westminster system in terms of developing out some horizontal accountability  
- think about human services 
- shift from a digital service to a human service 
- What is the citizen looking for? 
- What is the business looking for? 
And so we're not only thinking about the technology ecosystem, but the human ecosystem, and how the services affect change in communities. And when you think about those human services, you necessarily start to bundle some of the programs that we have in government together. And I think the idea of the quote from a GC leader here: "Being in the business of human services requires thinking about how, and where, and when to interact with the government."

"Being in the business of human services requires thinking about how and wheare and when to interact with government, and the tools that will support citizens to do that." - Digital Standard Users First.

What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- are their linkages to other problems or services that make sense to connect together (regardless if it's another department, regardless if it's another mandate)

  - leadership and the courage that we need to have, as public servants
  - So, really a bit of a mind shift. As I said at the beginning, this is a little bit different than you see in the past where we'll talk about some technical debt, and I'll get to that for sure. But this is really at the basis of how we're starting to think about how we design services.

 - agility and being iterative 

## North Star
And so, the denominator goes up, it has an effect here, but I think we can do better. And I think we need to think about how, as a North Star, if we want to be that top of the heap again, where people look to Canada in terms of how we're delivering services digitally, that gives you the license to have the courage, and gumption to actually change and challenge the status quo.

- And I think we need to have that courage and that openness, and digital does that. It allows you to have a dialogue around, I usually refer to digital as a bit of a Trojan horse, where you can start talking about technology, you can talk about policies and process. You can talk about the legislation that's in place, and challenge all those things. Challenge some of the service opportunities; challenge some of the service expectations that are out there, and all under the **guise** of digital. And I think it's a really cool way that we have in Canada, aligned service delivery and digital

- talent, expand our talent pool  Very difficult.  The talent pool is tight. We have a 30% vacancy rate in GC IT operations.   That does not think about evolving and moving foward.

Fortie - Minister of Digital Government
- How to accelerate the pace of adopting digital government
- What do we stop doing so we can focus on digital government

Our Ambition: To enable a government in the digital age for all Canadians by providing modernized tools for employees and accessible services fo buisnesses that expresses teh best of Canda in the Digital Age.

> It's bigger than digital. It's about transformation, change, enabling government to deliver better... We must move away from digital government—it's just government. That's the vision—it's just good government, and eventually it's invisible. We are there as the safety net when you need us." GC Leader

## rolling 100 snowballs 
? You know, rolling a hundred snowballs forward is interesting, but rolling a big one forward and actually achieving it, and getting over the goal line, that's something that makes an awful lot of sense. And I think it's something that we haven't been good at in terms of prioritization. We come up with a list of priorities, but we don't draw a line and say everything here needs to wait, while we actually succeed in some of these places.

- How do we do it once for government 
- So those types of models around thinking much more about enterprise is absolutely critical for us to be able to move forward in a digital age. 

# Theme 1: Excellence in technology and operations

Not a technology play, or plan - but we need to be excellent tech & operations (service standards, service expectations, ..)
- ability to measures those.

# Theme 2: Data-enabled digital services and programs

- Chief Data Officer for the federal government now, Stephen Burt.
- incredible amount of focus on data
- how we can leverage data across portfolios and across programs (no data silos)

# Theme 3: Action-ready digital strategy and policy

- define policies and establish performance against those policies and 
- iterate them
- example ERP policy (2012), it stagnated from my perspective.  It got refreshed, And, we wanted to use that as a model of saying, look, we can spend a year and consult, and do all kinds of information sharing with the policy as we move it forward, or we can get it 80%, right, put it out there and test it out, as opposed to doing something that's more academic and thinking about, what about this

# Theme 4: Evolution of structural funding, talent, and culture

## Funding

- Government of Canada is used to funding projects
- you'd have a project that would set up a program
- you'd have money to buy servers, or a data center 
- money would kind of go away, because you'd be finished the project
- And evergreening costs of infrastructure, which has led us to an incredible amount of technical debt that we have in the system and ecosystem today
- cloud: just a simple example, but if a program running on cloud is wildly successful, the usage of the cloud will go up, therefore cost will go up. That's not a model that our financial structure within government today is set for.  A successful cloud project will result in hight consumption and costs.  Stopping this cloud service is not going to happen, the funding needs to be aligned.
- we need to get ahead of that in terms of how we think about how funding is allocated to departments,
- start to think about sustainability of funding for both on-premise, and in the cloud

## Talent 

- Catherine Luelo, our CIO, has been talking, as one example in the FinTech area where she's working with FINTRAC and a few other organizations to see, are there opportunities for IT professionals in the FinTech space within Canada to actually work on some government programs for a period of time, come in, bring their experience, we benefit obviously as a government, they benefit as a sector, and they end up going back into their sector

## Learned:

- Concept of "Big Bang" is gone.  The concept of being iterative as we move through programs, and service delivery is where we're at now.   I think as requests come through the system within the federal system, treasury board submissions and so forth, we're starting to see that more iterative approach - milestones, as opposed to, give us the money for three years, and in three years you're going to have this great thing. The problem is in three years, maybe a government changes. Maybe legislation changes, and technology's definitely going to evolve.
  [!digital-ambition-stages-iterative.png])digital-ambition-stages-iterative.png)

  - Critical elements to think about is "how to do this iteratively". 
  - that's about proving the value of digital, and 
  - thinking about those digital standards that we have and 
  - how we sort of live by that, and 
  - really make some hard decisions based on that

## Governance

How we have a digital idea as an enterprise system and that's the only system that you can use.  Unless there's some wild reason why that wouldn't work for a program.

	- reduce the number of unicorns that we have, and snowflakes, because everybody's coming forward with their own individual systems to deliver
	- we need to be able to get to enterprise systems. does require us to prioritize, and say no to some things. *we need to have the courage to be able to start doing that*

# Stages of Digital Ambition 

We are embarking on the first high impact delivery stage of a longer journey.

- Invest in the Core
- Prove the Value of Digital 
- Scale the Impact
- Ultimate Ambition Government in a Digital Age 

# Q&A 


And I particularly appreciate your comments about the changing nature of the CIO from Chief Technology Officer to, maybe more commonly now, the Chief Transformation Officer, whether they have that title or not. I think that the C-suite of any department has to make room for transformation and the CIO or CTO, or even the CDO, is in many ways providing direction to the entire organization, not just to the IT people, which is a job that was traditionally the exclusive purview of the CEO or the COO, right?

- we do not need anothe C-suit executive 
- think about the Chief Service Officer.  We now have digital and service together, and we call this a Chief Digital Officer.  
- the value of a Chief Information Officer, Digital Officer, is they need to be absolutely conversant in the services of the organization that they work
- in the past the CTO/CIO knew how to keep technoloyg working (networks, data centers, blackberries).  If you knew how to keep people's blackberries working you were a great CIO.  "Take care of the pluming."


What type of governance changes are you seeing that can help enable success of large transformation?
- COVID:  When noone was going to Services Canada physical sites, the governance that worked was often rapid and with key decision makers.

	- key leaders, so the CTO for the Government of Canada; the head of the of CCCs; the Canadian Center for Cyber security; the executive VP over at Shared Services Canada, they got together daily to make decisions

	- **ANTI-PATTERN** - there wasn't, like in government we love having, well if you have a DM committee, you absolutely have to have an ADM committee supporting that DM committee. You probably need a DG committee supporting the ADM committee. We drown ourself in governance.


	- Rapid service delivery examples:  
	
	1. PM announces we will have CERB in two-weeks.  This provided clarity of focus, and, we had the allocation of resources to those areas of focus. 
	1. Roll-out 300,000 employees working from home, engage the vendor community to help support network service provisioning. 
	
	> "I'm suggesting that we need to do that on transformation projects," 

Applying this to key transformation projects at ESDC and IRCC.
- we call it nimble assurance and iterative governance
- you don't have these massive governance tables anymore that have all subsections 
- get the key decision makers together 
- make sure that you're not pushing every decision up to them (avoid pushing all decisions up)
- let people be accountable.  Empowering the teams to make the decisions they need to, have them understand the guardrails that they need to play in, but if those are the experts, and those are the people that are accountable at the director, DG, let them be accountable
- create an environment where if they're going to make decisions that something's going to fail, learn and move on.
- if you're doing that quickly, you can do that without a lot of negative impact, maybe a lot of positive impact
- testing out some different models with different programs to see what actually works.  (aligns with Gartner **Lanes** concept).

How do we balance digital everything, and service for all Canadians, including people who can't navigate the simplest of self-serve windows?
- accessibility by design 
- Accessibility from the beginning, otherwise it's a non-starter 
- have to courage to say "if it's not accessible by design, it's not happening" -— intestinal fortitude


How do you avoid falling back into the old habits instead of transforming forward?
- "So how do we actually create sustained change in this"? And I think that's every leader's challenge in this is to say, No, we're not going to go back, and we're not going to start passing around dockets that go from desk to desk. 
- We have to have the professional humility to make sure that the people that are around the table that are helping to make decisions, and decisions are taken by individuals, not committees
- if I'm the chair of a governance table, I want to have a lot of diverse voices at that table that are going to make sure that when I do make a decision, 
-  I'm going to be held accountable for that decision, I've got all the voices about why this will work, why this won't work, how this is going to affect productivity, how this is going to affect privacy.  You have to think about that. 


A question on gaps: What are the top one or two things that we need to do for the federal public service to be a leader in government? In other words, what are the key gaps that we need to close and surpass?

-  The courage to challenge the status quo.  public servant credo being: Providing fearless advice and loyal implementation.

  - I think we implement too many things, and we don't know how to un-implement things. We don't know how to turn things off. We've got technical debt that is surmountable, but not in this current government, for sure. It's extremely daunting as we look at how we can move forward with a service modernization agenda, but you're still taking all this technical debt with us. I mean, the joke that's out there is: Our Old Age Security Service and application, the code is actually old enough to apply for Old Age Security. 
  
  - We've seen a lot of "flash in the pan" kind of interesting things that get invested in, and tried out. And if they fail, that's fine, as long as you learn from it and continue to evolve. But a lot of things, there's a lot of bodies along the road here that, we've tried stuff, and we just, we stop. Or we continue to keep it on life support. I think we need to have the courage to say, we're not going to do that anymore. And we're actually going to focus resources and effort over here.   **ccmMercury**
  
- professional humility: the Westminster system, and thinking about how we deliver services is a bit of professional humility.   How could we deliver this, and who do I need around the table? Because I don't have all the answers, and my team doesn't have all the answers. So, who do we need to bring in around the table. And that could be other service partners, it could be private sector, it could be other governments.


Enterprise business architecture helps us understand our parts and their relationships. How are we building architecture capacity for the whole of government?
- CTO Shirley Ivan should answer. 
- need to start to create an enterprise architecture so we can think of systems from an enterprise perspective 
- we've got some standards, 
- we've got expectations around cloud

A digital transformation must be coupled with digital literacy for Canadians and employees in the public service. How are we doing in this area?
- briefings to Members of Parliament
- we're going to put some information on the TBS website about what a digital ID is, what are digital credentials, what is it not?  How to you maintain the trust with the public. They have that trust when they come in and they see a human on the other side of the shield now, or of the plexiglass now, and we need to think about how do we create that digital literacy, certainly in all ages, but a lot in some of the younger ages. 
- the Canada School of Public Service has got some great tools
- public consultations, which we need to do more of, we talk about open government 
- need to be open in that space, and find out what is concerning for Canadians 
- What is their level of understanding?


how do we balance being digital evangelists with the realistic workload expectations, or the capacity issues that this causes?
- leadership from all people 
- Why are we doing this, like this
- professional humility. Find out how, when if you're senior executive, when you're asking for something, what's the machine under you doing?
- we don't realize how much work goes into the development of products, the development of artifacts
- as executives take the time to open the hood, sit down with your employees and find out, so how does this actually work?
