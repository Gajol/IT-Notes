Application Lifecycle Activities
1. Value Stream Mapping
1. Capability Domain Mapping
1. Application Rationalization

# Communicating Investment Guidance.

The EA team will maintain the artifacts; however, the lifecycle and usage of a selected technologies must be maintained by the implicated domain architect.  UOttawa has 8 Technology Domains, 27 Technical Areas, 150 Building Blocks.

1. Technology Bricks : An architecture activity used to identify the lifecycle and recommended usage of the technology building blocks that are represented by the list of technology groupings within the Technology Reference Model.  Technology Bricks are used to help support the architecture activity of Application Rationalization and can serve as a Technology Roadmap.

1. Technology Reference Model : A product and vendor agnostic list of technology domains, technology areas, and technology building blocks that is used to classify current and potential technology investments and uOttawa applications.  This is the most abstract view to classify uOttawa technology investments.

1. Technologies : A list of vendor, open source, or 3rd party technologies that are associated to a technology brick.  The information can be used as the uOttawa Current State Technology Architecture.

1. IT Standards : The list of technologies belonging to a Technology Brick that have the INVEST lifecycle state and endorsed by ARB and provide Faculties, Services and IT teams investment guidance.

Technology Reference Model : {Technology Domain, Technology Area, Building Blocks}
Technology Bricks : {Building Block, Products (Tools and Technology), Lifecycle/Year}
