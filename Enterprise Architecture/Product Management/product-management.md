# Product Management

> You can’t build world-class software capabilities without world-class software product managers. They turn the creative force of engineers and designers into winning software products and services. — [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/every-company-is-a-software-company-six-must-dos-to-succeed)

Product Manager: Product Managers (PMs) drive development and build consensus throughout the entire product lifecycle. PMs typically apply their background in technology and business domains to define features and achieve product vision from product definition and planning through development, release, and end of life.

- Business Program Managers (BPM) work across the business to align major components of many projects simultaneously by organizing people and processes, and analyzing data to drive business decisions. As part of the business function of different organizations within [Microsoft](https://leap.microsoft.com/en-US/pathways/management/), BPMs help strategize and orchestrate delivery and improvements of various programs and processes that impact business results.

> Successful companies don’t just create products to address known customer needs. They also deeply understand customers’ unspoken and evolving needs and look at new ways of adding value. But how? Product management leaders are at the center of this shift and must expand their view to manage the entire product experience — addressing those unspoken and evolving needs — to continually deliver more value. — Forrester

# Product versus Project Approach

Percent of Application Development FTEs workload involving applications using a Product versus Project Approach

- Project approaches to application development treat the work as a one-time effort with the aim of creating a product or service. It has a start and end date, as well as a defined result.
- Product approaches to application development differ from a project approach as they don’t look at it as a one-time effort. In a product approach the application evolves and adapts to business needs to prove its worth. 

Other characteristics are:

- Products are aggregations of business capabilities that are consumed by the business organization.

- The perception, from a business perspective, is at the user interface (UI) or groups of UIs level, which is linked to capability.

- The perception, from the IT perspective, is based on aggregates of functions used by a consumer, not on business capability.

- The delivery method (build, buy, cloud, software as a service [SaaS], etc.) of a product is inconsequential to the business, but important to IT.

- A product can be process-centric or information-centric.

- The business cares enough about the product to associate a budget for its purchase, enhancement and maintenance over a given life cycle.

- The product has a life cycle, from conception to retirement.

# Product Manager vs Scrum Master

Product managers and scrum masters are both important roles in the software development process, but they have distinct responsibilities and focus. Here's a comparison of the two roles:

**Product** **Manager**

- Defines product vision, strategy, and roadmap
- Prioritizes features and user stories based on business value and customer needs
- Communicates with stakeholders and manages expectations
- Collaborates with cross-functional teams to ensure product success

**Scrum** **Master**

- Facilitates agile scrum process and removes obstacles for the team
- Ensures team members understand and follow scrum practices
- Protects the team from distractions and interruptions
- Facilitates ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review

While a product manager focuses on the overall product strategy and direction, a scrum master focuses on the day-to-day management of the agile development process. Both roles require excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as an understanding of the software development process. In some organizations, a single individual may take on both roles, while in others, the responsibilities may be split between two or more people.

## Product Owner vs Prod uct Manager

**Product** **Owner**

- Owns the product backlog and prioritizes user stories and features based on business value and customer needs
- Acts as the voice of the customer, ensuring that the product meets their needs and expectations
- Collaborates closely with the development team to provide clarity on user stories and prioritize work
- Participates in ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review

**Product** **Manager**

- Defines product vision, strategy, and roadmap
- Conducts market research and competitive analysis to inform product decisions
- Collaborates with cross-functional teams, including marketing, sales, and engineering, to ensure product success
- Measures and reports on product performance and customer feedback

While a product owner focuses on the day-to-day management of the product backlog and ensuring that the product meets customer needs, a product manager takes a more strategic approach, focusing on the overall product vision and direction. Both roles require excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as a deep understanding of the customers and the market. In some organizations, a single individual may take on both roles, while in others, the responsibilities may be split between two or more people.

## Product Adoption

The responsibility for product adoption typically lies with both the product manager and the product owner, although the roles and responsibilities may vary depending on the organization.

The product manager is primarily responsible for defining and communicating the product's value proposition, identifying target customers, and developing a strategy for reaching them. They are responsible for positioning the product in the market, creating marketing materials and messaging, and working with the sales team to promote adoption.

On the other hand, the product owner plays a critical role in ensuring that the product is meeting the needs and expectations of the customers. They work closely with customers and stakeholders to understand their pain points and desired features, and use this information to prioritize user stories and features in the product backlog. This helps ensure that the product is continuously evolving to meet customer needs, which is a crucial factor in driving adoption.

In summary, both the product manager and product owner have roles in driving product adoption, with the product manager focusing on positioning and promotion, while the product owner ensures the product meets customer needs.
