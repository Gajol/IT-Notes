# Bacon

Four steps bacon goes through when cooking:

1. Fat melts
2. Collagen turns into gelatin
3. Moisture evaporates
4. Browns via the Maillard Reaction

Each step:

1. Fat melts @ 130<sup>o</sup>F: Rendering turns inedible raw fat into goodness.  Makes bacon seem moist (disintegrates when gets in mouth) fat transports flavour and aroma molecules.  Rendered fat coats each piece which allows even distribute of heat allowing the bacon to raise in temperature.  This continues to occur throughout cooking
1. Collagen turns to gelatin at 170<sup>o</sup>F.  Collagen holds bacon together and makes chewiness of meat.   As fibres become gelatin bacon biomes more tender.
2. Moisture evaporates 212<sup>0</sup>F.  Causes splattering.  Water is released in raw bacon and water evaporates.  The high the heat the more rapid the expansion and more splatter.
3. Browns at 280-330<sup>o</sup> : occurs rapidly.  Smells good through the Maillard Reaction.  Occurs noticeably and rapidly.

# Two variables

**temperature and time**

- manage temperature of heat source so you can control each step takes.

Four ways:

- super fast

- steady

- oven at 280

- add water in pan.  Water heats bacon to 212 until all water evaporates.  Fat is rendering and collagen turning to gelatin, once water evaporates, temperature raises to quickly turn burn.  Makes it more chewy and tender.

The Maillard Reaction is responsible for the cooked colour and flavour of bread crusts, chocolate, coffee beans, dark beers and roasted meats, all foods that are not primarily sugar.
