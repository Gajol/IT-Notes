# Change Your Questions, Change Your Life

## Tool 1 : Empower Your Observer

See Chapter 2 "A Challenge Accepted"

Purpose:  To cultivate the ability to be still, calm, and present with ourselves and others. This capacity is the foundation of equanimity that helps us to become more present, centered, resourceful, and strategic. The observer self is also the basis for self-reflection and the ability to engage in intentional change.

Discussion:  Nonjudgmentally witness your thoughts, feelings and actions.   By being in the "observer" mode/capacity we are more likely to be in control of our thoughts, feelings and actions.   In the observer mode we are less likely to be controlled by people and circumstances outside ourselves.  As observer you notice what is detached from personal thoughts and feelings.

Practice: 

1. When phone rings, let it ring and observe your reactions.   Observe what is going through your mind. 
2. When in a challenging situation where you want to impulsively react and act and express thoughts and feelings, switch into observer mode.   Nurture (cultivate) patience and observe.   When you take action, after being in observer mode, your actions will be more thoughtful, strategic and mindful.
3. Take a few minutes to be alone when faced with an important choice, or when you notice your are in Judge mode.   Sit quietly, note your thinking, feelings and desires (wants) at the moment.  Allow yourself time to observe, by realizing it is not the time to act.   Simply observe and not.

## Tool 2: Use the Choice Map as a Guide

Purpose: To provide a visual summary and guide for noticing one’s Learner/Judger mindset as well as the questions, and the future, that each of these might lead to.

Discussion: This is a mindfulness visual too used to help you be aware of the types of questions you are asking, Learner or Judger.

Practice:

1. Experiment take each path separately by asking either Judger or Learner questions about the situation and consider the results each might produce.    *Where am I right now? Am I in Judger? Where do I want to be? What is my ultimate goal in this situation? Which path will take me where I want to go?*
