# Queen Elizabeth Cake

- Recipe: Alternative Recipe: [All Recipes - Queen Elizabeth Cake](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7666/queen-elizabeth-cake-i/).  This recipe is very similar, but does not include the warm sauce.

**Story**:  The origins of this cake are shrouded in mystery, although some sources claim the cake was first made for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.  The event required a cake that took little sugar and butter and few eggs - all still rations in the UK in the early 1950's.  Whatever its history, the cake has become a Canadian classic, and you'll understand why when you taste it.[^1]

# Ingredients

Cake:

- 1 cup pitted dates, cut in half 
- 1 cup water
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flout
- 1 tsp baking power
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp fine sea salt
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

Topping: 

- ¾ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- ½ cup lightly packed golden yellow sugar 
- ⅓ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 Tbsp whipping cream (35%)

Sauce

- 1 cup lightly packed golden yellow sugar
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup whipping cream (35%)

# Cooking Tools

- 8-inch springform pan  (I used a 9-inch springform pan)
- wire rack for cooling cake

# Instructions

1. Preheat over to 350°F  (180°C)
2. Grease springform pan and line the base with parchment paper (I used a T-Fal like pan and did not use the parchment paper)

Cake:

1. Combine the dates and water in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.   Turn down the heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, until the dates have absorbed the water and turn into a pulpy mixture (about 5-minutes).   Remove from heat and set aside.

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, and using an electric mixer, beat the butter with the sugar and vanilla extract until pale and fluffy (about 1-2 minutes, stopping to scrap sides once or twice).   Beat in the egg until well combined.
3. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture alternately with the dates, making three additions of flour and two of dates, and beginning and ending with the flour.  Stir until well combined.  Stir in the walnuts.
4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.

Topping: 

1. Just before the cake is ready, combine the coconut, sugar, butter and cream in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly.  Turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 1-minutes, stirring often.
2. As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, preheat the broiler to high.  Spread the hot topping over the top of the cake.  Broil the cake until the topping is dark golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.   Watch it carefully, as the topping burns easily.  (I only broiled for about 1 minute, and it had started to burn - I broiled on top-rack which was maybe too hot).   
3. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes.

Sauce:

1. Combine both sugars and the cream in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Turn down the heat to medium and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth.   *The sauce can be cooled, then refrigerated in an airtight counter for up to 5 days.  Reheat gently before serving.*

Serving:

1. Release the sides of the pan and slide the cake onto a serving plate.   Serve the cake warm or at room temperature with the warm sauce.  *The cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.*



# Queen Elizabeth's Funeral

We had this cake in honour of Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral, September 19, 2022.   Grandpa joined us for Sheppard's Pie and dessert.    Without less than an hours warning, Grandpa was tasked with making a toast.   After the entré had been cleared and before dessert was served grandpa gave the toast.   Grandpa indicated this was customary etiqueete for [Toasting the Queen](https://d21toastmasters.org/toasting-the-queen/).   We toasted the Queen, and grandpa added that in his lifetime he had sworn an oath to three Queens.   The first the Queen of Denmark, the second the Queen of England and the third your Grandmother.

Grandpa mentioned everyone stood for the toast, except one time when he was in training for EMO (Emergence Measures Office??) where one person refused to stand.

On a less serious note, Grandpa was questioning what mooning someone meant, is it funny or rude.  Could he moon people?   We did not know what he was thinking, until saying goodbye...

## Loyal Toast

The following is the [usual procedure](https://d21toastmasters.org/toasting-the-queen/)[^2]:

1. After the entre has been cleared and before dessert has been served, the host or the toastmaster rises and asks for the attention of those present so that they may join in a toast to Her Majesty, the Queen. He/She asks the guests to rise. Once all have risen the toastmaster raises his/her glass and says:
   *“The Queen, La Reine”*
   without any other words and without music.
2. Those present respond:
   *“The Queen, La Reine”*
   drink the toast and sit. It is not appropriate to click glasses.
3. Members of the Royal Family do not participate in nor respond to the toast.
4. Generally any beverage may be used for the loyal toast with the exception of cocktails. However, it is preferred to drink the toast with wine or water.
5. The Loyal Toast is always the first one to be proposed. No other toasts should be proposed until the loyal toast has been made.

Occasionally, the Loyal Toast may be made at another point in the programme; however, in all circumstances the Loyal Toast should be the first proposed.
