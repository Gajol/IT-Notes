# Part 1: Two Systems

# Part 2: Heuristics and Biases

## The Law of Small Numbers 

## Anchors

Two different mechanisms produce anchoring effects:

- System 1:Occurs by a priming effect, an automatic manifestation. The concept of suggestion is a priming effect; which selectively evokes compatible evidence.

- System 2: A deliberate process of adjustment, starting from the anchor.  

Priming research indicates that our thoughts and our behaviour are influenced (much more than we know or want) by the environment of the moment.

## Science of Availability

Availability Heuristic: 1971 definition: the process of judging frequency by "the ease with which instances come to mind."

Unknowns in 1971:

- is this heuristic a deliberate problem-solving strategy, or, an automatic operation?   Answer: both systems are involved.

Availability heuristic, a heuristic of judgment, substitutes one question for another.   How the heuristic leads to biases can be discovered by listing the factors other than frequency that make it easy to come up with instances.  Each factor is a potential source of bias; the availability bias.

- Scandals among politicians attracts your attention.  Similarly sex-scandals among celebrities attracts attention.  Therefore you are likely to exaggerate the frequency of celebrity divorces and political sex scandals.  Factor = salient event.
- Other factors: dramatic event, personal experiences.
- Why one spouse feels their personal contribution to keeping a place tidy is higher.  "Availability Bias".  Spouses also over-estimate their contribution to cause quarrels (i.e., the bias is not always self-serving)
- Why a member of a collaboration effort on a team feels they contributed more.

Ease with which instances come to mind is a System 1 heuristic.

A focus on content is a System 2 heuristic (which replaces System 1 when more engaged) 

- People who let themselves by guided by System 1 are more strongly susceptible to availability bias (compared to those in a higher state of vigilance using System 2).  These people "go with the flow" and are affected by "ease of retrieval" more than by the content they retrieved.   This can be influenced (i.e., it is not constant for a person):
  - being engaged in an effortful task
  - in a good mmood
  - score low on a depression scale 
  - are knowledgeable novices on a topic (in contrast to true experts)
  - score high on a scale of faith in intuition 
  - if they are (or feel) powerful

## Availability, Emotion and Risk

Our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.  

affect heuristic: People make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions.  Do I like it?  Do I hate it?  The affect heuristic is a substitution form where an easier question (like / hate) is used to answer a much harder question.   The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality.

availability cascade: [^sunstein] Availability is a self-sustaining chain of events.  (media report of a minor event, to public panic, to large-scale government action.)

### Risk

| Sunstein                                                     | Slovic                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Availability Cascades: distort priorities in the allocation of public resources | affect heuristic                                             |
| Proposes mechanism to isolte dcision makers from public pressures.  Allowing the allocation of resources to be based on impartial experts who have a view of all risks and the resources available to reduce them | Less trust in the experts and more trust with the public.   Believes the public would reject policies form isolated/insulated experts (insulated from the public emotions) — an impossible situation in a democracy. |
|                                                              | Policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from fear<sub>emotion</sub> (not only real dangers) |
|                                                              | Public resistant to decisions made by unelected or unaccountable experts. |

## Representativeness & Logic

The conflict between the intuition of representativeness and the logic of probabliy.

- Example: Describing a person as active in the feminist movement, and then asking are they more likely to be a bank teller, or, a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement.   The later is a subset of bank teller and therefore less likely, but many choose this.   Representativeness beats logic.

## Less is More 

- People incorrectly provide more value to a set of {10 valuable things}, than to a set of { 10 valuable things, and 3 invaluable things }.   Less is more.  The lower valued items affect the value of the whole.  Hence, less is more.

## Causes Trump Statistics

The concept is that people are inheritently bad at statistics.  The concept of statistics is quickly lost on people (even statisticians).  People want to have a plausible story and find cause (causal mindset).

> "We can't assume that they will really learn anything from mere statistics.  Let's show them one or two representative individual cases to influence their System 1."

## Regression to the Mean

The concept of luck and unluck creates the outliers.  In their next attemp (venture companies next year, businesses next year, golfers 2nd day, fight pilots next training session) the ones who did poor will do better, and the ones that did amazing will do worse.  

Two statements say the same thing, but one evokes interest and emotion and curiosity, and the later intuitively makes sense (is obviously true and not interesting at all). 

> a) Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent.
>
> b) The correlation between intelligence scores of spouses is less than perfect.

- [correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient): A **correlation coefficient** is a [numerical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_measure) of some type of [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence), meaning a statistical relationship between two [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)).

> Depressed children treated with an energy drink improve significantly over a three-month period.

- A set of depressed children will naturally improve over time.  The study would need to be compared to a control group.  The control group is expected to improve with regression alone.  The aim of the experiment is to determine whether the treated partiens improve more than the regression can explain.

Speaking of Regression to Mediocricity.

> "Perhaps his second interview was less impressive than the first because he was afraid of disappointing us, but more likely it was his first that was unusually good."

## Taming Intuitive Predictions

Address the concept that people who see one good trait, extrapolate that trait to other traits (or vice versa) when there is likely no correlation to the traits.

- prediction matches evaluation.  The prediction of future is not distinguised from an evaluation of current evidence.  The example is a description of some with average (but good traits) {intelligent, self-confident, well-read, ...}; the study shows people judged these questions identical (the first is an evaluation/description, the second is a prediction):
  - 1) How much does the description impress you with respect to the candidate?
  - 2. What is the your estimate of the GPA that the student will obtain?

Another study, was the young 4 year old girl who was a precocious reader.  The question was what would her GPA be.   People's intuitive equates reading at a young age to a high-GPA; and ignore the many factors specific to reading-age and GPA.

- reading age = shared factors + factors specific to reading age = 100%
- GPA = shared factors + factors specific to GPS = 100%

What is the correlation coefficient between reading age and GPA?

### Procedure to Count the Biases of Discrete Prediction 

bias of discrete prediction: neglect of base rates and insensitivity to the quality of information.    Applies to predictions on a scale (e.g., GPA or revenue of a firm) and judging the probabilities of outcomes.

1. **baseline prediction**: if you knew nothing about the case at hand.  In a categorical case this is the base rate.  In a numerical case it is the average outcome of the category.
2. **intuitive prediction**:  what is the number that comes to your mind 
3. **intermediate prediction**: a number between the first tow  
4. **default**:  if there is no information use the baseline prediction. 
5. **use the intuitive prediction**:  this is the extreme case when you are completely confident in your initial prediction after a **critical review** of the evidence that supports it.
6. **correlation**: pick a place between the two as you weigh the doubt and the correlation between you intuitive judgment and the truth (i.e,. it is unlikely your intuitive is perfect)

# 3. Overconfidence

## Illusion of Understanding

Illusion of Understanding:  We often say "I knew the stock market would crash.".  This is false, and should be replaced with "I thought...."

- knew: we can know something only if it is both true and knowable.   You cannot conclusively show the stock market is going to crash.  Premonition and Illusion would be better words to use.

social costs of hindsight: once the someone changes their mind, they have a hard time remember why they believed the other point of view.  — *hindsight bias*

### Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias is unkind to decision makes who act for others (physicians, financial advisors, third base-coaches, CEOs, social workers, diplomants, politicians).  

- People are prone to blame them for good decisions that turn out bad.
- People are prone to not credit them for successes that appear obvious after the fact.

Outcome bias: When the outcomes are bad, people blame others.  

Examples of hindsight bias:

- A bridge that was damaged when the city chose not to hire a monitor.  24% of one group, shown only the at-the-time evidence, thought the city should hire a monitor.  56% of a second group, who were informed that debris did block the river, but informed to not let hindsight distort their judgment, thought the city should have hired the monitor.
- 9/11 hindsight bias: July 10, 2001 George Tenet (director of CIA) knew of al-Qaeda planning a major attack, but only briefed the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.  Washington Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, declared, "It seems to me elementary that if you've got the story that's going to dominate history you might as well go right to the president."

## recipes for success

System 1 wants the world to by tidy, simple and predictable, and coherent.  The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the illusion that one can predice and control the future.

- stronger CEO and firm success has a 0.3 coefficient of correlation

## Illusion of Vanity 

cognitive illusion: even though a past failure of a prediction is known, people still have confidence in using the same approach for similar predictions (example: measure cadets during an exercise and predicting who will be a leader).  The testers, accepted the fact intellectually that they did poorly.  But it had no impact on either their feelings or on subsequent actions/predictions.

illusion of skill:  the stock market industry.  Cognitive illusions are more stubborn than visual illusions. — *illusion of valid prediction*

## Illusions of Pundits 

Our ability to construct and believe choerent narratives of the past makes it difficult for us to accept the limits of our forecasting abilities.  (from *The Black Swan*)

Speaking of Illusory skill:

> "She has a coherent story that explains all she knows, and the coherence makers her feel good."

## Illusions vs Formulas

Simple statistics can outperform experts. 

- Orley Ashefelter used an algorithm using only three weather-related-features; average temperature, amount of rain at harvest-time and total rainfall to predict wine prices to an accuracy of 0.90.  
- Experts try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex combinations of features to make predictions.  Formulas and Statistics keep it simple
- See Meehl's book[^disturbing] which shows how statistics beats experts.

To maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas; especially in low-validity environments.

## Hostility of Algorithms

algorithms: mechanical, atomistic, additivity, cut and dry, artificial, unreal, arbitray, pedantic, ..

clinic method: dynamic, global, meaningful, holistic, subtle, sympathetic, patterned, deep, genuine, sensitive

It is improper and unethical to rely on intuitive judgments for important decisions if an algorithm is available that will make fewer mistakes — Meehl.

Steps: 

1. Select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in the position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, ..). Ideally the traits are independent.
1. You should be able to assess these traits by asking factual questions.  1..5 scale (very-weak...very-strong)
1. Collect information on each trait one at a time to avoid the halo effect 
1. Hire the candidate whose score is the higest.


# Idioms

- Wisdom of Crowds: [Wisdom of Crowds - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp): Wisdom of crowds is the idea that [large groups of people](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/011404.asp) are collectively smarter than individual experts when it comes to problem-solving, decision-making, innovating, and predicting. The idea is that the viewpoint of an individual can inherently be biased, whereas taking the average knowledge of a crowd can result in eliminating the bias or noise to produce a clearer and more coherent result.

  The theory is often applied to financial markets to show why markets in some instances operate efficiently and other times, inefficiently. Market participants in the crowd need to be diverse and have an incentive for markets to function efficiently. See original book [^Wisdom]

# Principles

Principle of Independent Judgement :  Before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position.  This procedure makes use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the group.  The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.  [ Part 1, Chapter 7 - A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions]

Law of Small Numbers: The law of small numbers is the bias of making generalizations from a small sample size. In truth, the smaller your sample size, the more likely you are to have extreme results.   People are not adequately sensitive to sample size.  Problem extends to small counties and small schools.[^smallschool]

If you consider how much you should pay for a house, you will be influenced by the asking price.

Advice:  When the other party starts with an outrageous proposal (high price) do not make an equally outrageous counteroffer.  This creates a gap that will be difficult to bridge in further negotiations.   Instead, make a scene, storm out, or threaten to storm out.   Make it clear, to yourself (to break the anchor effect) and to the other side, that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table.  
  - *Any number of the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high (buying a house) you should ask yourself to combat the effect*.

- Stereotyping: neutral word is psychology (bad word in culture).  There is a social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling.  This has been beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society.  However neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments.  The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society.
- Test of Understanding Psychology:  The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact.  There is a deep gap between our thinking about statistics and out thinking about individual cases.  It is better to learn psychology through individual cases, than by statistical means.

# Illusions

Three Men Illusion 



## Biases of Judgment

Overconfidence:  We fail to allow for the possiblity that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing.  Our beliefs depend mostly on the quality of the story.

Framing Effects:  Presenting the same information differently can evoke different effects.  The odds of surviving are 90%.  The odds of dying are 10%.

Base-Rate Neglect

Heuristics and Biases Approach:  

General Bias:  Favours certainty over doubt.

Hindsight Bias: Once the someone changes their mind, they have a hard time remember why they believed the other point of view. They are no longer able to argue their original point of view. — *hindsight bias*

Judgment of representativeness: Ignoring base rates and determining relation by representativeness (description of person being nerdy and guessing they are in engineering, when the base-rate of humanities is much higher).  Substitution is used, since the question of probability is more difficult than the question of similarity is easier.  People substitute the easier question to answer; invoking a mental shotgun.   Example, Moneyball where scouts (representativeness ; look & feel like an athlete) was replaced with statistics about past performance.

See Gilovich for Biases discoveries [^Gilovich]

- Confirmation Biases: The mother of all biases.

- Hot hand Bias

- Spotlight Effect: frequent disparities between the way we view our performance (and think others will view it) and the way it is actually seen by others

- Bias Blind Spot: the tendency to recognize biases in other people, but not in ourselves

- Clustering Illusion: the tendency to see "clusters" of data in a random sequence of data as non-random
- Illusion of non-transparency: the tendency to overestimate the extent to which people telegraph their inner thoughts and emotions
- Heuristics research:
  - self-handicapping: attempts to manage how others perceive us by controlling the attributions they make for our performance
  - regret 
  - anchoring

# Quotes

> "We evolved to be goal-striving creatures. You'll regret more the things that you didn't do than the things you did."

—**Thomas Gilovic**

> "Plans are best-case scenarios.  Let's avoid anchoring on plans when we forecast actual outcomes.  Thinking about ways the plan could go wrong is one way to do it."

—**Think Fast, Think Slow - Speaking of Anchors**

> "I don't spend a lot of time taking polls around the world to tell me what I think is the right way to act.  I've just got to know how I feel." - Availability Bias

—**Goerge W. Bush - November 2002**

> "The emotional tail wags the rational dog."

— **Jonathan Haidt Psychologist**

> "Defining risk is an exercise in power"

**— Slovic - The Perception of Risk[^slovic]**

> "Subject's unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only their willingness to infer the general from the particular."
**— Nisbett and Borgida - The Helping Experiment**  *When aware of the general statistic that 45% will not help, students still predicted a person would help.  When show particulars of two people not helping, they were quick to infer a low rate of people helping.*

#  Inventions

1953 Anaesthesiologist Virginia Apgar developed standard procedure to prevent infant birth deaths.  Prior to this much deliberation was done, danger signs missed, and many new-borns died. — A systemic assessment of new-borns; 5-variables heart rate, respiration, reflex, muscle tone and colour.   Rate each one 0, 1 or 2; sum them for the Apgar score.  A consistent standard.

# Thoughts

- 1/8 (12% chance) these three great villians might not have existed (they could have been female).   It is impossible to argue that history would have been roughly the same in their absence.   Long term developments are not predictable; since these three people had incredible impact on the world, but they may not have existed.
