# WK1: 

User Experience (Ux): The user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

Product: A product is a good, service, or feature. It might be a physical product, like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch. 

Usable: User experience is about improving usability or making something easier to use. This means that the design, structure, and purpose of the product are clear to everyone.

Equitable: Considering the unique needs of many different people is important work and thinking about equitable design is key. Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. User experience is also about making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product. 

Enjoyable: User research to collect evidence on how they're experiencing that product in real time and ask them about it, too. 

2018 McKinsey & Company studied companies in three industries: medical technology, consumer goods, and retail banking. They found that, regardless of industry, businesses that focused on good usability and design performed better than their competitors.
