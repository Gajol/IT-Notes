# Impact Pie

- Yield: 1 medium cake (my cake tin is 20 cm/8.5in.)Preparation time: 5–10 minutes
- Baking time: 45–50 minutes
- Equipment: Food processor, cake tin

## Ingredients:

- 225 g (1½ cups) raw peeled celeriac, diced 
- 3 large eggs
- 10 Medjool dates, pitted (200 g)
- 2 Tbsp. coconut oil/butter or plant-based “butter”
- 1.5 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract or seeds from ½ a vanilla pod 
- 1 lemon, zest for the batter
- ¼ tsp. salt
- 50 g (⅓ cup) cashews + extra for decoration
- 30 g (¼ cup) rolled oats

### Optional Icing:

- 12 Medjool dates, pitted 
- ½ cup boiling water 
- Vanilla extract to taste
- 4 Tbsp. of melted coconut oil or vegan block
- 1 pinch of salt
- Lemon to taste

NOTE: If you don't have a food processor, shred or grate the celeriac as fine as humanly possible on a grater, this is a somewhat time consuming process, but will work.

## Process:

Preheat the oven to 175⁰C/ 350⁰F.

1. In a food processor, add all the ingredients and combine well.Once blended or combined, it might look a bit split and watery; that's okay. Just make sure it's somewhat smooth; it should look almost like marzipan.

2. Grease and dust your baking tin. 

3. Fill it with the batter. Press it down firmly and smooth the surface with a wet rubber spatula. If you are making muffins or cupcakes, you can use baking paper in small squares made to fit a muffin tin. I added a large scoop of batter to each.

4. Bake for 45–50 minutes until it's golden brown and spongy. The large cake tin will need closer to 55 minutes. Poke it to test for firmness. If it feels spongy and not mushy or wet, it's done. If your finger breaks through it, bake it some more.

5. Optional Icing: If you are not training with this cake, you can ice it! Soak the dates in boiled water for 5 min. Strain the water from the dates and keep it to adjust the texture. In a blender, blend the soaked dates with 2 Tbsp. water, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Add the melted coconut oil while blending to get the desired texture. Season with lemon juice or salt if needed.

6. Cool down the cake, ice it, and serve it.
