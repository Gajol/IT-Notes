Synching
- This application will sync purchased books to the Kobo.

- This application will neither sync books on the Desktop Adobe Digital Editions to the Kobo nor to the Kobo Desktop Application

## Will the app sync to/from the Kobo?
I guess I need to link the Kobo account a kobo account?  Not sure what that means, I used Google tuborgjunior SSO.  Not sure why nothing syncs.   On the Kobo Deskop it shows "Link Kobo Account" as an option (but my account is the google SSO account) - or do I need to create a Kobo account???
