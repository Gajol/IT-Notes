## October 13: Call backed regarding email on status

First call said not until new year Dec/Jan of roof

Second call said spring April / May and to call to discuss options

## October 20: Calling Natoya...

Three options

1. wait for 1st general
2. find a contract
3. do work yourself

Process

1. Will send email with the scope.   Contractors didn't send, since they were busy.

1. They send authorization.  They won't start repairs until a later time.  So situation is different. 

1. What happens if there is subsequent damages through the winter.  Let The Personal know.  It should ... - that would be separate claim.  Emergency.  If there is water coming in, we can let you know.  Contact a moving company.

   - 3rd light bulb in hallway, call and let us know.   Send ou

   - t contractor.  If not able we must contact roofing to mitigate losses.  It is not a separate claim.

1. on Option 2; what is my scope.

1. Will exact analysis. 

1. Review email.   It goes over the areas, square footages and amounts and price.   

1. Make decision.  Go with First General.   I choose other, limited by $11,600 budget.

Apologize for dealy in scope being sent.

    - How it works: 
    - When you share any single photo in Google Photos, it creates an unlisted link that is accessible to anyone including those who are not logged into their Google Accounts. Internally, the embed app downloads the page behind this link and extracts the Open Graph tags to determine the direct link of the image and the underlying photo album.

## What is the problem?

1. looking for a content host for website
1. offer an endpoint or way to embed content directly in webpages

### URL Addressable Content

objects in S3 are URL-addressable

- [Using S3 to store web Content](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/using_s3_to_sto/)
  - [AWS S3 Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html) : Allows user-defined metadata

### Curiousity?

- How does Dropbox and Google Photos prevent the "URL" from being used as a content host?  Is this cross-site ?

# Technology

- [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)
- [hotlinking](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/hotlinking): Hotlinking is the act of using another site’s bandwidth by displaying their website asset – like an image, video, or audio file – on a different website via a direct web link.  When this happens, the original website owner must cover and pay for these server resources each time a web browser wants to load and view the asset.
  - [Prevent Hot Linking](https://www.blogginglove.com/prevent-image-hotlinking-but-allow-google/):  .htaccess file (allow Google Search Engine, but block others with RewriteRules)
- [Direct Link - inline linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking)
