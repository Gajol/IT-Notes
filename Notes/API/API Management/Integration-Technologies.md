|Technology|Description|Example|
|--|--|--|
|API management|API management products and technologies allow you to define and publish APIs using web-based protocols and formats. They focus on developer (that is, consumer) enablement, policy enforcement and lightweight mediation of underlying service implementations.|Googleâ€™s Apigee Edge, Software AG webMethods API Gateway, MuleSoft Anypoint API Manager|
|Integration platform software|Application integration suites include enterprise service buses. A platform ESB is the traditional deployment model for integration suites and platforms. This category assumes you are centrally deploying a farm of ESB servers and managing the software centrally. You develop integration flows using application and technology connectors, logic flow steps and transformations, and deploy them into or onto the ESB platform.|Oracle Service Bus, TIBCO BusinessWorks, Microsoft BizTalk Server, Software AG webMethods, IBM App Connect Enterprise, Mulesoft AnyPoint
|Data integration tools|Includes tools for change data capture (CDC), extraction, transformation and loading (ETL), and data virtualization. The primary goal for such tools is to allow data structures that were designed independently to work well together.|Informatica PowerCenter, Talend, Oracle Data Integrator, Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), IBM Infosphere Information Server
|Distributed integration platform|The distributed integration platform (DIP) category covers integration platform software that you have to install and manage yourself, where the integration flows do not share a single runtime. DIPs are containerized versions that can be deployed in hybrid, distributed environments via Kubernetes and its derivatives.|MuleSoft Anypoint, Red Hat Fuse, IBM App Connect
|iPaaS|Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on-premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.|Dell Boomi, Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services, Jitterbit, Microsoft Logic Apps, MuleSoft Anypoint Online, Oracle Integration Cloud, SnapLogic, SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite, Workato|
|Integration frameworks|Integration frameworks provide a lightweight approach to developing and embedding integration flows into your application and service implementations. They provide a code- or configuration-based, domain-specific language (DSL) that simplifies the implementation of common integration patterns. Integration frameworks also provide adapters to common application technologies and protocols.|Apache Camel, Akka Alpakka, Spring Integration, Project Flogo, Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Apache Airflow, Apatar, Apache NiFi, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Talend Open Studio
