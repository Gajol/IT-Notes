GraphQL as a Query Language

GraphQL
: Use GraphQL as a query language to fetch data from your data-sources directly, without the need for a running gateway server, or any other bottleneck.

GraphQL Mesh
: With GraphQL Mesh, you can use GraphQL query language to fetch from (almost) any data source, without changing the source or modify it's code. [GraphQL Mesh API Documentation](https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/getting-started/introduction)

The way GraphQL Mesh works is:

Collect API schema specifications from services
Create a runtime instance of fully-typed SDK for the services.
Convert API specs to GraphQL schema
Applies custom schema transformations and schema extensions
Creates fully-typed, single schema, GraphQL SDK to fetch data from your services.
