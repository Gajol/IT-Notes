Good API design introduces controls to help manage their own API life cycle, including [ref: Deloitte Tech Trndes 2018](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends/2018/api-program-strategy.html)[Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkwXSmFk-_xpgoZWBglzpgq62xGZyA?e=Izrtnx):
--Versioning. The ability to change without rendering older versions of the same API inoperable.
- Standardization. A uniform way for APIs to be expressed and consumed, from COM and CORBA object brokers to web services to todayâ€™s RESTful patterns.
- API information control. A built-in means for enriching and handling the information embodied by the API. This information includes metadata, approaches to handling batches of records, and hooks for middleware platforms, message brokers, and service buses. It also defines how APIs communicate, route, and manipulate the information being exchanged.
