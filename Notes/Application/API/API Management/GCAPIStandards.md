- Jon Postel Law RFC 760

  - One of my favorite examples of this is Postel’s Law. Sometimes it is called ‘The Robustness Principle’, but I think that Jon Postel deserves to have his name attached - it was a tremendous insight. Postel was an instrumental figure in the early days of the internet. Aside from his Law he is probably best known for the DNS Root Authority Test - a courageous act that was equally sublime.

  - History and biography aside, Postel’s law was a simple observation that he made about networking. In an early internet RFC he said "an implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.” This has been paraphrased over the years as “Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send” and for people who are mathematically inclined: “be contravariant in your inputs and covariant in your outputs.”
