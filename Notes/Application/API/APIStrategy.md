Why:  
APIs are criticl to the success of the ???
APIs will continue...
As per the GC guidance, application development is API-centric.   Applications will be composed of individually deployable components which integrate via APIs.   This is move away from monolithic applications towards composable services and the microservice architecture style.

Developer Experience:  
 - Improve API Discovery: Today our api's are no discoverable by other developers.  It is difficult to learn what APIs and integrations are possible due to difficulties in find API's to access services.  An API Repository / Catalog needs to be available to allow developers access the existing API assets.
 - Improve API Consistency: Shared templates, guidelines.
 - Improve Quality: APIs are the contract between systems for integration.   
Reusability:
Versioning:
Internet Facing: PB-workloads, SSA (...)
