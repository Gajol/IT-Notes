# podcast : Why Writing Matters

[reference Salesforce podcast Why Writing Matters for Engineers](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish/118-why-writing-matters-for-engineers)
- [Peter Naur's 1985 - Programming as Theory Building](https://gist.github.com/dpritchett/fd7115b6f556e40103ef).   This article is basis for move from waterfall ([Taylorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management)) and Agile.

- Cognitive Bias - illusion of explanatory depth 15:40 mark.
  - people cannot explain in-depth the program.
  - toilet - 7/10 - steps as you flush.

  17:30 : Context:  jump from classroom (retaining knowledge) and transferring that into the context you are going to use it.  

  20:00 Cognitive Bias - curse of knowledge
  - too much detail, impossible to follow what they are saying.
  - what we don't have enough of - context, why it exists, who built it, what problems have we had in the past, ...
    - remember that others do not know the things you know.
    - separate details and context
    - cognitive overload; avoid complex language, terminology.
    - try to use scaffolding: here's what we all know, analogies help for story telling, build on the most basic.
    - think about every word you are writing
    - normal adult reads at a 9th grade level, comfortable reading is 2-levels below (7th grade) - therefore popular novels are written for the 7th grade
    - do not write to create "credibility" or "intelligence": when trying to write to share, communicate and persuade. Write to share for audience.  
    - Pinker describes acedemic writing (and technical writing) as bad.
    - story-tell : use a story as part of your communication.  Helps on scaffolding; a common foundation for the conversation.  Stories make things easier to remember (20X easier)
