- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Automation:
Scripting enables Automation: Installation and Configuration should be scripted, with scripts being managed in version control systems (Gitlab).  Scripting also enables:
- usage of variables for supporting various environments
- script goals: scripts should be idempotent (allowing re-execution producing the same results)
