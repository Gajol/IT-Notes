  - Had talk with Mike and he likes API approach and wants to be included
  - Had talk with Amy and Raman was unable to communicate my ideas of API gateway and the value
  - Amy mentioned CMS / DL review with TRB and pattern exists to expose things into lkae.
  - Amy we have a pattern for cms to lake that altor should follow.  If this pattern does not align with my Vision for api management...  ...timely for better approach..chat with Amy
  - Ent search ODP
  - Ent Search of everything....pattern...Ent layer...Build special index........LRS Extract...
  - Leverage Gartner.
  - Enterprise pattern push i n discovery
    - ...by SPM
    - ...what is MAM...open-siurce MAM,  image Strategy
    - - ...by Archs...tech media management, search, ...
    - ...install on-prem...
  - Reference Arch  
    - look and know how to integrate to lake, to ecm how expose data to catalog, BI,. Search
    - TRB to Lake via REST API...
    - ...Q'S does it reflect API vision...
    - Amy meaning of API management...talk to her... focus of API management
   - What is Important arch to invest in...
     - IdAM...
     - Palantir access.
     - CMS model different classifications can see 90% of case....HS case....
  - EDA
  - Help projects to skeleton  to build projects to.
  - Side of desk....discovery roadmap to focus....

  1. Task Management : What is solution?  Responded, who are the tasks being managed by (i.e., is the user-base within department or OGD - does solution need to cross air-gaps)
  1. Raman: 4 Pillars:
    - Consistency: leverage same architecture, design patterns to help DEV drive consistency & future staff mentoring .
    - Integrity, Robustness, Consistency
    - Observability
    - Data Driven Testability

# TO DO
- [ ] : Enterprise Reference Architectures
- [ ] : Enterprise Application Reference Architecture
- [ ] : [c4model](https://c4model.com/) - system __c__ontext, __c__container, c__omponent, __c__ode
- [ ] : Scope/Audience : identify scope (Gartner How to Doc App Arch recommendation)
- [ ] - Developer Experience : How can archtecture improve Developer Experience (modern technology, known expecations, concern resolution channels, ...)
- [ ] - Interrogatives What-Date, How-Function, Where-Network, Who-People, When-Time, Why-Motivation. Refer to [DoD AF](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/DoD-Architecture-Framework/dodaf20_interrogatives/)
- [ ] - Applicability to Agile - from [Gartner 2021 - How to Document Application Architecture - G00750245](https://www.gartner.com/document/4008341) *Which framework you use matters less than using a framework in the first place. Bear in mind that the more heavyweight and prescriptive the framework is, the less well-suited it is to agile development. If your internal processes call for you to create detailed architecture documentation in the early phases of a development effort, then they’re not agile.*
