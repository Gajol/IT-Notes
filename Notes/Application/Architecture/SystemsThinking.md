Systems Theory in Engineering
- Systems engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user's needs
- Systems engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and disposal.

Systems Thinking
Systems thinking is a vantage point from which you see a whole, a web of relationships, rather than focusing only on the detail of any particular piece. Events are seen in the larger context of a pattern that is unfolding over time.
- Systems thinking is a perspective of seeing and understanding systems as wholes rather than as collections of parts. A whole is a web of interconnections that creates emerging patterns. – [Peter Senge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge) and the book [The Fifth Discipline - 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge)

Why use Systems Thinking?
- To find the most important places for intervention to change the long‐term behaviour of a system.

Systems Thinking - 4 Fundamental Concepts
1. Interconnectedness
1. Synthesis
1. Feedback Loops
1. Causality

Analysis : Analysis Is about dissection of complexity into manageable components. Analysis fits into the mechanical and reductionist worldview, where the world is broken down into parts.  (Analysis looks into things.)

Synthesis : Is about understanding the whole and the parts at the same time, along with the relationships and the connections that make up the dynamics of the whole. (Synthesis looks out of things.)

approach
1. Identify a system
1. Explain the behaviour or properties of the whole system (Synthesis)
1. Explain the behaviour or properties

Questions to ask:
1. What depends on what?
1. What is causing what?
1. Where are the information flows?
1. Where control decisions are made?
1. What information flows are critical?
1. How to best engage stakeholders?
1. How best to manage or intervene in the system for desired result?

Tools
1. brainstorming tools
1. dynamic thinking tool
1. structural thinking tools
1. computer based tools


# Juran - Steve Jobs
- [Management Theory - Human Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran) : Juran is widely credited for adding the human dimension to quality management. He pushed for the education and training of managers. For Juran, human relations problems were the ones to isolate, and resistance to change was the root cause of quality issues. Juran credits Margaret Mead's book Cultural Patterns and Technical Change for illuminating the core problem in reforming business quality. His book Managerial Breakthrough, published in 1964, outlined the issue.

- Juran met the creator of the Pareto Principle - In 1941, Juran came across the work of Vilfredo Pareto and began to apply the Pareto principle to quality issues (for example, 80% of a problem is caused by 20% of the causes). This is also known as "the vital few and the trivial many." In later years, Juran preferred "the vital few and the useful many" to signal that the remaining 80% of the causes should not be totally ignored.
