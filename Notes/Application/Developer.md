- Front-End : The code that builds the user-interface.  HTML and CSS are key skills.  A site/page maybe rendered client or server-side.  The rendering involves HTML and CSS.  Front-end frameworks could be Reach, Vue, Angular in the JavaScript space.  
  - Other skills include UI expertise (standards, guildeines, ) and SEO (Search Engine Optimzation) and Open Graph (ability to include metadata OpenGraph, DublinCore, etc) to work effectively in the global web experience.  
- Client-Side : For a mobile application developer this would be software that is executing on the mobile.   For a web-developer this is software executing in the browser.
- Back-End : Anything happening on the server that is not relating to the user-interface.  Data retrieval, manipulation and storage are common examples.  Back-end JavaScript frameworks include Rails, Django, Laravel, Express.js.
  - PHP, Ruby, Python, .Net are common languages.  SQL
- Server-Side : Often relates to data storage and retrieval.  Node.js is a JavaScript server to run/interpret JavaScript.
