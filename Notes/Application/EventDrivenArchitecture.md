# Event Driven Architecture

Why?  When fire-and-forget is appropriate.  You are not requesting something.
- a user signed up
- you have a follower
- you completed something
- notification of in-game events


CDC - Change Data Control

Core Concept:
Pub-Sub Model

Technology trends that drive event-driven architecture:
- microservices
- distributed architectures
- cloud native applications (integrations)

# EDA / Distributed Computing

APis: API specs serve a crucial role in defining and governing distributed computing systems leveraging the concepts of request/reply RESTful interactions, event-driven architecture, microservices and Webhooks, but AsyncAPI and OpenAPI are used for different styles of integration. [ref: Solace](https://solace.com/blog/asyncapi-vs-openapi/)

# EDA Standards
- [AsynchAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) : AsyncAPI is an open source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). Our long-term goal is to make working with EDAs as easy as it is to work with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management. Most of the processes you apply to your REST APIs nowadays would be applicable to your event-driven/asynchronous APIs too.
