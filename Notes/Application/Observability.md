Understand the unknown, unknowns.  Rather a new domain.


[observability - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) : Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. In control theory, the observability and controllability of a linear system are mathematical duals.

[Observability - Splunk 2022 Predications](www.splunk.com) : What’s missing is observability, which allows companies to see how their complex webs of cloud services are actually performing, and diagnose problems that affect customer experience directly and fix them, whether it’s in the application code, the user interface or the infrastructure performance.

Observability
: Observability provides deep visibility into modern distributed applications for faster, automated problem identification and resolution.

Cardinality
: In the context of databases, cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values contained in a set. Low cardinality means that a column has a lot of duplicate values in its set. High cardinality means that the column contains a large percentage of completely unique values. A column containing a single value will always have the lowest possible cardinality. A column containing unique IDs will always have the highest possible cardinality.
