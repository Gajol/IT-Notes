Law of Demeter
: The law of Demeter attempts to divide responsibilities between classes and reduce coupling between them. The idea comes from the “only talk to your friends” idiom.

It is highly recommendable to:
- Keep software entities independent of each other.
- Reduce the communication or coupling between different classes.
- Put related classes in the same package, module or directory to achieve cohesion.
