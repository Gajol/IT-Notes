## Competition with China

[ ] - what about EU GPDR?
- USA most be careful in how applications are developed and fielded.

Andrew Moore (Google Cloud / Carnegie Melon) - 6 elements
hw
algorithm
people
data
application
integration

Then you have AI for any mission set.

USA leads in 3 areas:
- h/w semiconductors
- algor - companies
- people - attracting best people to come and study

Chine leads in:
- data - obvious reasons
- app - use data on minorities
- integration - china integrating into one-piece (domestic political system )

## Ethical Considerstaions
USA Value System - what defines USA and differentiates us in clear ways.
- freedoms matters (values)
- privacy matters (values)
- national security matters (outcome)

Nation of Laws.  Balance.  How can we use technology to ensure values are protected.
- Data Policy Protection - sure 10%% confident it will remain protected, but insights can be shared across the network to get the swarm intelligence.
