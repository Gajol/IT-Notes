[Reference and Master Data Management - RDM, MDM](https://www.ewsolutions.com/reference-master-data-management)

Reference data is data used to classify or categorize other data.  Examples of reference data include code lists, taxonomies, and hierarchies of data, etc.  Most reference data sets change slowly.  Metadata about reference data sets may document:

- The meaning and purpose of each reference data value domain

- The reference tables and databases where the reference data appears
- The source of the data in each table
- The version of the reference data that is currently available
- Reference data last update date
- Maintenance description for the reference data
- Business data stewardship information for the reference data

Master data is data about the business entities that provide context for business transactions.  Unlike reference data, master data values usually are not limited to pre-defined domain values.  Business rules typically dictate the format and permitted ranges of master data values.  Common organizational master data includes data about:

- Categories such as individuals, organizations, and their roles, including customers, citizens, patients, vendors, suppliers, business partners, competitors, employees, students, etc.

- Products, internal and external, inventory, and related concepts.
- Financial structures, including general ledger accounts, cost centers, profit centers, etc.
- Location concepts, for the organizations and individuals and other entities that concern the enterprise.

Master Data Management is the process of defining and maintaining how master and reference data will be created, integrated, maintained, and used throughout the enterprise.  It is a complex endeavor and requires the inclusion of several data management disciplines (data governance, metadata management, data integration, data quality) and the use of all the areas of enterprise architecture.
