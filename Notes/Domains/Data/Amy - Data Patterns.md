# Amy - Data Patterns

I recommend following known design patterns for data abstraction, I listed the following patterns in the Reference Data Architecture as a starting point. See links below. 

路     DTO (Data Transfer Object Pattern) https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html  

路     Summary of data abstraction patterns that leverage the DTO concept https://medium.com/mastering-software-engineering/data-access-patterns-the-features-of-the-main-data-access-patterns-applied-in-software-industry-6eff86906b4e路     

路     Microsoft list of design patterns https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/ (Note, these have a cloud focus but can be used in other situations, in particular consider CQRS, Pipes and Filters, and Queue Based Load Leveling)
