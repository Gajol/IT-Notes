## Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Acumen, StoryTelling

- draw insights from data, and communicating to management in simple terms and visualizations (core responsibility of a data analyst)
- define questions, handle mssing values, outliers, formatting, filtering, univariate and multivariate analysis
- data visualization: libraries matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- dashboards: Excel, PowerBI, Tableau 

## Data Engineering

Data engineering underpins the R&D teams by making clean data accessible to research engineers and scientists at big data-driven firms. 

- comprise building an efficient data architecture, streamlining data processing, and maintaining large-scale data systems.
- use Shell (CLI), SQL, and Python/Scala to create ETL pipelines, automate file system tasks, and optimize the database operations to make them high-performance
- a crucial skill is implementing these data architectures which demand proficiency in cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and others

Learning Data Engineering:

- [Data Engineering Nanodegree by Udacity ](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027)— as far as a compiled list of resources is concerned, I have not come across a better-structured course on data engineering that covers all the major concepts from scratch.
- [Data Engineering, Big Data, and Machine Learning on GCP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-data-machine-learning) — You can complete this specialization offered by Google on Coursera that walks you through all the major APIs and services offered by GCP to build a complete data solution.
- [AWS Certified Machine Learning (300 USD) ](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/)— A proctored exam offered by AWS, adds some weight to your profile (doesn’t guarantee anything, though), requires a decent understanding of AWS services and ML.
- [Professional Data Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer) — Certification offered by GCP. This is also a proctored exam and assesses your abilities to design data processing systems, deploying machine learning models in a production environment, and ensure solutions quality and automation.

## Applied Statistics and Mathematics

Statistical methods are a central part of data science.

- **Descriptive Statistics** — to be able to summarise the data is powerful, but not always. Learn about estimates of location (mean, median, mode, weighted statistics, trimmed statistics), and variability to describe the data.
- **Inferential statistics** — designing hypothesis tests, A/B tests, defining business metrics, analyzing the collected data and experiment results using confidence interval, p-value, and alpha values.
- **Linear Algebra, Single and multi-variate calculus** to understand loss functions, gradient, and optimizers in machine learning.

Learning Statistics 

- [Learn college-level statistics](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-statistics-course/) in this free 8-hour course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel
- [[Book\] Practical statistics for data science](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/149207294X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=QOOZP96ISCU4&dchild=1&keywords=practical+statistics+for+data+scientists&qid=1610247485&s=books&sprefix=practical+stat%2Cstripbooks%2C362&sr=1-1) **(highly recommend) —** A thorough guide on all the important statistical methods along with clean and concise applications/examples.
- [[Book\] Naked Statistics ](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data/dp/1480590185)— a non-technical but detailed guide to understanding the impact of statistics on our routine events, sports, recommendation systems, and many more instances.
- [Statistical thinking in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1) — a foundation course to help you start thinking statistically. There is a second part to this course as well.
- [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)— offered by Udacity. Consists of video lectures explaining widely used measures of location and variability(standard deviation, variance, median absolute deviation).
- [Inferential Statistics, Udacity ](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)— the course consists of video lectures that educate you on drawing conclusions from data that might not be immediately obvious. It focuses on developing hypotheses and use common tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression.
- And here's a [guide to statistics for data science](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statistics-for-data-science/) to help you get started down the right path.

## ML and AI

There are three major types of learning:

1. **Supervised Learning** — includes regression and classification problems. Study simple linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, naive Bayes, logistic regression, KNNs, tree models, ensemble models. Learn about evaluation metrics.
2. **Unsupervised Learning** — Clustering and dimensionality reduction are the two widely used applications of unsupervised learning. Dive deep into PCA, K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and gaussian mixtures.
3. **Reinforcement learning** (can skip*) — helps you build self-rewarding systems. Learn to optimize rewards, using the TF-Agents library, creating Deep Q-networks, and so on.
