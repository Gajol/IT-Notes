[data Wrangling](https://theappsolutions.com/blog/development/data-wrangling-guide-to-data-preparation/)  (also known as Data Munging) is the process of transforming data from its original “raw” form into a more digestible format and organizing sets from various sources into a singular coherent whole for further processing.

[data wrangling - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)
- Discovering:
The first step of data wrangling is to gain a better understanding of the data: different data is worked and organized in different ways.
- Structuring:
The next step is to organize the data. Raw data is typically unorganized and much of it may not be useful for the end product. This step is - important for easier computation and analysis in the later steps.
- Cleaning:
There are many different forms of cleaning data, for example one form of cleaning data is catching dates formatted in a different way and another form is removing outliers that will skew results and also formatting null - values. This step is important in assuring the overall quality of the data.
- Enriching:
At this step determi
ne whether or not additional data would benefit the - data set that could be easily added.
- Validating:
This step is similar to structuring and cleaning. Use repetitive sequences of validation rules to assure data consistency as well as quality and security. An example of a validation rule is confirming the accuracy of - fields via cross checking data.
- Publishing:
Prepare the data set for use downstream, which could include use for users or software. Be sure to document any steps and logic during wrangling.
