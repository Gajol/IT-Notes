I think the definition of the TDR was changed somewhere along the lines if I understand what you're saying :(
It was meant to be a conceptual grouping of data technologies we wanted to push forward - a data lake (lake/pond), data warehouse, and relational databases to name a few. it was meant as a path/opportunity to evolve our data story from silo'd data stores with different approaches/schemas/etc. and converge. This does not mean a one size fits all everything is running off the lake (not advisable for things like relational datasets - though technology is improving to allow this to happen). in any case, as Phil R told me, no matter what i say right now i'm not there to help push the vision so i'll just have to deal with/unravel/improve on whatever state we're in when i get back :D
