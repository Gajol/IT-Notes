https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform. It started at Airbnb in October 2014[2] as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows. Creating Airflow allowed Airbnb to programmatically author and schedule their workflows and monitor them via the built-in Airflow user interface.[3][4] From the beginning, the project was made open source, becoming an Apache Incubator project in March 2016 and a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project in January 2019.
