# Types of Data
- Unstructured Data: Data found in email, white papers, magazine articles, corporate intranet portals, product specifications, marketing collateral and PDF files.

- Transactional Data: Data about business events (often related to system transactions, such as sales, deliveries, invoices, trouble tickets, claims and other monetary and non-monetary interactions) that have historical significance or are needed for analysis by other systems. Transactional data are unit level transactions that use master data entities. Unlike master data, transactions are inherently temporal and instantaneous by nature.

- Metadata: Data about other data. It may reside in a formal repository or in various other forms, such as XML documents, report definitions, column descriptions in a database, log files, connections and configuration files.
Hierarchical Data: Data that stores the relationships between other data. It may be stored as part of an accounting system or separately as descriptions of real world relationships, such as company organizational structures or product lines. Hierarchical data is sometimes considered a super MDM domain because it is critical to understanding and sometimes discovering the relationships between master data.

- Reference Data: A special type of master data used to categorize other data or used to relate data to information beyond the boundaries of the enterprise. Reference data can be shared across master or transactional data objects (e.g. countries, currencies, time zones, payment terms, etc.)

- Master Data: The core data within the enterprise that describes objects around which business is conducted. It typically changes infrequently and can include reference data that is necessary to operate the business. Master data is not transactional in nature, but it does describe transactions. The critical nouns of a business that master data covers generally fall into four domains and further categorizations within those domains are called subject areas, sub-domains or entity types.

# [Master Data - Wikipedai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data)

Master data represents "data about the business entities that provide context for business transactions".[1] The most commonly found categories of master data are Parties (individuals and organisations, and their roles, such as customers, suppliers, employees), Products, Financial Structures (such as ledgers and cost centres) and Locational Concepts.

Master data should be distinguished from [Reference Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_data). While both provide context for business transactions, reference data is concerned with classification and categorisation, while master data is concerned with business entities.

Master data is, by its nature, almost always non-transactional in nature. There exist edge cases where an organization may need to treat certain transactional processes and operations as "master data". This arises, for example, where information about master data entities, such as customers or products, is only contained within transactional data such as orders and receipts and is not housed separately.
