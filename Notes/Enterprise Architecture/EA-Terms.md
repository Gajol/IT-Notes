Enterprise Architecture Framework in a Nutshell (visual-paradigm.com)
Zachman Framework is an enterprise ontology and is a fundamental structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a way of viewing an enterprise and its information systems from different perspectives and showing how the components of the enterprise are related. The Zachman Framework goes beyond IT. It offers structural connections into any aspect of an enterprise.
The rows of Zachman Framework focus on describing the enterprise from six viewpoint perspectives of the stakeholders. These six perspectives are based on English language interrogatives ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘who’, ‘when’, ‘why’, and ‘how’ (known as W5H). https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/enterprise-architecture/enterprise-architecture-framework-in-a-nutshell/
