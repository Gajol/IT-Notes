git Personal Access Token
: git config --global credential.helper manager
The first time you are pushing to a repo, a popup will ask for your credentials: username and your PAT.  The next time, it won't ask, and reuse directly that PAT, which remains stored securely in your Credential Manager.
([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46645843/where-to-store-the-personal-access-token-from-github))

- [Caching GitHub credentials in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).  Can use github cli (need to install gh), or, use Git Credential Management (GCM).  For GCM:
1. need to install git
2. [install and configure GCM](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager#linux-install-instructions)
3. configure git to use GCM - see [GCM Linux](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/docs/credstores.md) - options change based on credentials store you choose

Commands I did (Jan 2022)
[GCM install](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager#linux-install-instructions) - to [cache github crednetials](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)

``` sh
sudo dpkg -i <path-to-package>
git-credential-manager-core configure
// cd to directory where I wanted repository
git init
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

On Github create PAT - personal access token. - GH-pages

## Jekyll Install
- [Good overview of creating Repo and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
1. [Publishing Source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites) : The publishing source for your GitHub Pages site is the branch and folder where the source files for your site are stored.
2. [Mime Types](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db#adding-custom-media-types)

```sh
$ jekyll new --skip-bundle .
# Creates a Jekyll site in the current directory
```
