[OMB Circular No. A–130, ‘Managing Information as a Strategic
Resource’](https://www.cio.gov/policies-and-priorities/circular-a-130/) provides policy and guidelines for [ revised policy - A-130](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf):
- information governance,
- acquisitions,
- records management,
- open data,
- workforce,
- security, and
- privacy

Importantly, it represents a
shift from viewing security and privacy
requirements as compliance exercises to
understanding security and privacy as
crucial elements of a comprehensive,
strategic, and continuous risk-based
program at Federal agencies [[ref](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-07-28/pdf/2016-17872.pdf)]
