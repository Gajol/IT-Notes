Innovation: DesignOps, Design Sprints, Total Experience

Trough: Inclusive Design, Design Thinking, 

Slope: 



Design Thinking

- Design thinking is a multidisciplinary process used to improve the design of digital and analog products and services. Design thinking helps to design high-value solutions and improve their usability. It starts with empathy for users and the gathering of insight about their needs and motivations. They are then developed using an iterative, experimental approach. Deep customer insight, combined with a creative process, is ideal for digital innovation and digital product development.
- Why: A proven methodology applied to a broad range of business problems, design thinking typically enhances the usability and user experience (UX) of analog and digital products and services. UX is a key element of the total experience, affecting both the employee experience (EX) and customer experience (CX). Leading organizations regularly practice design thinking on new, digital projects/products, and it can also link to lean startup and agile methodologies, enhancing application development.
- Business Impact: Design thinking can be a crucial element of UX, which is critical for both the Employee Experience (EX) and Customer Experience (CX). The usability of products and services affects key performance indicators (KPIs), such as customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer effort score, customer/employee retention, conversion, revenue and market share.

Gamification:

- Gamification is the use of game mechanics and experience design to digitally engage and
  motivate people to achieve their goals. It is important to distinguish gamification from
  video games and loyalty programs, as gamification uses techniques from behavioral
  science to “nudge” people into achieving their goals.

Inclusive Design

- Inclusive design is a design methodology that aims to draw on the full range of human diversity and ability, to inform and create digital products responsive to the needs of the greatest number of people. Due to various barriers and discrimination, many people are unable to participate in all aspects of society. This exclusion directly affects the lives of people, as designers often do not consider attributes like disabilities, age, culture, ethnicity, gender or religion.
- Why: Inclusive design is a movement in the design community to use its skills and influence to create a more just, open and accepting world in which digital spaces and communities are open to the full range of people in society. The intent is to design with diversity in mind to improve the user experience for all constituencies. One aspect is to address the needs of people with disabilities, but it extends beyond that to the areas of bias and cultural considerations as well.
- Business Impact: From a business perspective, inclusive design is a means to expand one’s offerings by including the broadest set of users, representing the diversity that is inherent in today’s society.

MXDP (Multiexperience Development Platform): A multiexperience development platform (MXDP) offers development teams an opinionated and integrated set of front-end development tools and “backends for frontends” services. Its purpose is to enable distributed and scalable development (both in teams and architecture) of fit-for-purpose apps across digital touchpoints and interaction modalities.

- Why: A MXDP unifies front-end application development activities across heterogenous types of apps so that the user experience (UX) across these apps is seamless, persistent and enjoyable. MXDPs ensure maximum reuse and accelerate development velocity.
- Business Impact: .... Simplifying the construction and composition of complex front-ends that speed-up application development and deployment....
