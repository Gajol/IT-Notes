Lean is considered a philosophy of continuous improvement.  A lean organization focuses on increasing customer value, the elimination of waste and optimizing operations.  The key components of Lean can be applied to all types of business and processes. Lean IT is the extension of lean principles to the development and management of information technology (IT) products and services. [[UoCA-SF - Lean IT](https://itsm.ucsf.edu/lean-it)
