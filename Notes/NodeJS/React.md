## React vs Angular

Both are good frameworks, don't overthink it.  There are likely other considerations like available skillset that are more important.

- Angular:  is considered ideal for creating single page-fast performing apps.
- React is a compelling choice for web & mobile app development projects requiring quick rendering services. 

| Parameter              | Angular                | React                                 | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation         | Framework              | Library                               |                                                 |
| Performance            | Use DOM, slower        | Use virtual DOM, improves performance | React is faster                                 |
| Scalability            | Modular architecture   | Component based                       | Angular is more scalable                        |
| Difficulty             | Steep Learning Curve   | Simple Learning Curve                 | React wins                                      |
| Code Base Size         | ~1MB                   | ~0.2MB                                | Reach is smaller (but you need other libraries) |
| Community              | Lower cost developers  | Higher cost to hire a developer       |                                                 |
| Who Uses the framework | Google, Paypal, Upwork |                                       |                                                 |
