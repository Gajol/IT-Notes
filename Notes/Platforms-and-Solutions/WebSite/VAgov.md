## Drupal Lessons Learned
https://www.drupalgovcon.org/2020/program/sessions/lessons-learned-re-platforming-vagov-drupal-12-months
- A small team assembled by the US Digital Service, in partnership with the VA, set out on an ambitious mission to stand up a custom Drupal CMS for the Department’s flagship website, VA.gov. The team created the de-coupled infrastructure and developed the content model while migrating the highest priority content from the existing static site, while simultaneously re-imagining, re-designing, and re-writing, VA’s largest digital presence - the Medical Center sites. The team delivered major portions of VA.gov including the homepage and primary Veteran-facing content hubs in staggered releases over the first 12 months, and launched the new VA Medical Center site after 15 months. There were some stressful times, many exciting moments, and a lot of lessons learned.
  - A workspace is an isolated collection of content revisions on your site. For example, you might have a "Live" workspace which is what all visitors see when they visit your site. Then you might have a protected "Stage" workspace where content editors prepare new content before it's pushed to the Live workspace.

  - However, the Workspace module itself doesn't provide any functionality for pushing content between workspaces. See the below list for recommended modules to use for this.
