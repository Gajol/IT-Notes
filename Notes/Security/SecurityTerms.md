- CVE - CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number.

  Security advisories issued by vendors and researchers almost always mention at least one CVE ID. CVEs help IT professionals coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address these vulnerabilities to make computer systems more secure.
