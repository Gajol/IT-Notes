TypeScript offers a whole lot of other great mechanisms like interfaces, classes, utility types and so on. Also, on bigger projects you can declare your TypeScript compiler configuration in a separate file and granularly adjust how it works, how strict it is and where it stores compiled files for example. You can read more about all this awesome stuff in the official TypeScript docs.

Some of the other benefits of TypeScript that are worth mentioning are that it can be adopted progressively, it helps making code more readable and understandable and it allows developers to use modern language features while shipping code for older Node.js versions.
