# Data Teams

The five jobs to be done by modern data teams are: 

1. **data activation** – making operational data available to the teams that need it
2. **metrics management** – the business needs shared definitions and a baseline of key metrics
3. **proactive insight discovery** – team members outside of the data team are limited in the questions they can ask by their limited knowledge of what data exists and what questions can be asked
4. **driving experimentation** – driving measurable impact to the business through A/B experimentation moving key business metrics in the right direction
5. **interfacing with the data** – empowering team members across the business with the information and conclusions they need to be unblocked
