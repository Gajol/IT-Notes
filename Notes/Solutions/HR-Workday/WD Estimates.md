A project of this magnitude requires rigorous preparation and highly qualified people. [ref uOttawa Next ERP](https://www.uottawa.ca/pop/en/news/next-erp-system-getting-ready-proof-concept-phase)

# Prototypes
You must make prototypes of your service to explore, share and test different designs before you commit to building anything.[ref: GOV UK Design Patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-prototypes)
Prototypes can vary in style from a quick pen and paper sketch to a code prototype that works like a fully interactive website.
- You should use the prototype that best meets your needs at the time.
- Sketches are useful for exploring and discussing basic ideas with colleagues.
- Code prototypes are better for user research because theyâ€™re more realistic.
