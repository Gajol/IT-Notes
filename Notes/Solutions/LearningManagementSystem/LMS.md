# Quality Requirements - Non-Functional
Many of our projects are delayed, paused or cancelled due to non-functional requirements.  The root cause of these has not been discussed or documented as part of lessons-learned.   One possible cause is the difficulties in standing-up technology in an air-gapped environment disconnected from the internet.  The following is a brief list of quality requirements that often de-rail projects progress.   These should be considered when doing options analysis and during the project lifecycle.
1. Classified Training : Training available on a TS-network.   Assume security categorization is TSMM.
1. Bilingual : Training in both official languages.
1. Accessible : Training regardless of accessibility as we often get our business-requirements phrased as.   Assume WCAG 2.0 at a minimum.
1. IM : Export-as-PDF (PER - non-LMS requirement, ???)
1. IM : Disposition - ability to set retention time on information.
1. IM : unknowns...
1. IM Privacy : should not be an concern on (C) network.
1. IT : SSO, ...
1. Performance Management : Data and Analytics

## LMS Standards
Not sure we need to be compliant with these, but these are easily googleable standards within the learning management system domain.
1. - [SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) compliance to be useable on multiple LMS systems (SCORM 1.2 / SCORM 2005)
1. [Learning Tools Interoperability - LTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability)
  - [Deep Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking) : Ability to link in a reliable manner to content witin a web-site.  Many trickle-on requirements of deep-linking (sharing, access, ...).  See also [Persistent URLs](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v1p0/schema/openapi/3.0/clr.json).
  - [LTI 1.3 Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/)
  - LTI : The specification allows and specifies a method for the exchange of data between the LMS and external tools (see Learning Tools Interoperability, IMS Global Learning Consortium [IMS Global/IMS]).
  - Not relevant as we do not have other learning tools to integrate to.
1. [LMS - Comprehensive Learner Record - CRL](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record).  See the [LMS CRL OpenAPI specification](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v1p0/schema/openapi/). See [7 Things to Know About CLRs](https://credentialengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Educause_Comprehensive-Learner-Record.pdf) by [Credential Engine - Making All Credentials Transparent](https://credentialengine.org/)
