# jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

[Good Tutorial - Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). :
If you want to host your site on GitHub Pages as we did in this lesson, you can only use the Jekyll plugins already included in the GitHub Pages gem we installed (hereâ€™s a [full list of what you installed](https://pages.github.com/versions/) when adding the GitHub Pages gem to your Gemfile earlier).

A Read-Eval-Print Loop [](REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) is an interactive interpreter to a programming language. It originated with LISP systems, but many other languages (Python, Ruby, Haskell, Tcl, etc.) use REPL's to manage interactive sessions. They allow for simple experimentation with a language by bypassing the compile stage of the "code -> compile -> execute" cycle.
There are 4 components to a REPL (named in LISP notation):

- A read function, which reads input from the keyboard
- An eval function, which evaluates code passed to it
- A print function, which formats and displays results
- A loop function, which runs the three previous commands until termination

- interesting search to find open-source sites like NIST - https://government.github.com/community/
