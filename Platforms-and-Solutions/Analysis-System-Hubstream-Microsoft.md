## Discussion Notes

Started 20 years ago with Microsoft.  Child exploitation, suspects, large hard drives.  10 years @ Hubstream.  National Cybercrim (RCMP) to cooperate and collaborate with partners

Data Deluge: massive information to teams, get informed versus drowning in information.

Awareness -> Analysis -> Action

- source of data
- dark web crawlers
- cryto currency information
- bring in data from sources

Data Hub

- data management: case, leads, entities
- analytics
- collboration
- workflow

Link charts, visualization and collaboration.

Sensitivity: deployed in sesnsitive environments (PB), child abuse images.  SOC 2 certified

Service

- multi instance
- structured and unstructured
- policies
- ethical AI
- hybrid: have a hybrid but do not recommend (NCA-UK deployed)

Azure native technologies

- 20 years with Microsoft
- data sovereignty
- Azure DevOps to build private instance.  Not in the Azure marketplace

Templates

- Magna forensics: export magna-format
- case management
- online / offline intelligence
- authorization letter

RCMP

- public tender for Cyber NCS: National Coordination Centre
- Track: watch lists, public reports, tasks, service requests, projects, files, RFI, indicators of compromise, public reports: Canadian Antifraud Centre.
- Based on rich data model.  Rich model which drives system.  Model is configured (e.g., cryptocurrencies)

API's to receive information

Link Chart: Visualization to suggest connections

## Data in Two Ways

### AI

- AI pulls in data, and suggests entities (phone number, email address,) with a confidence score.  Preview, Human-review and click Add
- Overview page summarizes information and informs of matches to other data
- all data, history and actions in the data hub
- link charts:  goal not massive with 1,000's of nodes.  Goal is to show connections (collapse things not linking)

### Import Structured Data

- import hub.  Build map to entity or data
- system learns format & mapping for re-use.  Suggests mapping by format

## Facial Image Recognition

- Cannot match to known entities.  NO, but its on the evolution roadmap for child protection offering.   Microsoft trying to know rules of engagement for facial recognition.
