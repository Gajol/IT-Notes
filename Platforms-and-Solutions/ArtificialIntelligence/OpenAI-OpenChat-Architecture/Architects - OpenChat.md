## How can an application architect influence executives

There are a few ways an application architect can influence executives:

1. Communicate the value of good architecture: Executives are often focused on the bottom line, so it's important for the application architect to be able to explain how a well-designed architecture can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase revenue.
2. Make a compelling case for investment in architecture: An application architect can make a case for investing in architecture by presenting data on the benefits of good architecture, such as improved maintenance, faster deployment times, and lower risk of failure.
3. Show the consequences of poor architecture: It can be helpful for the application architect to demonstrate the potential consequences of neglecting architecture, such as increased technical debt, difficulty in scaling the application, and increased maintenance costs.
4. Demonstrate expertise and credibility: An application architect should be able to demonstrate their knowledge and experience in the field, as well as their ability to lead and make sound architectural decisions.
5. Collaborate and build relationships: An application architect should work closely with other stakeholders, including executives, to understand their needs and goals, and to build relationships that can help to influence decision-making.

## What skills should an architect develop to influence executives.

An application architect can develop the following skills to influence executives:

1. Strong communication skills: An application architect should be able to clearly and effectively communicate the value and importance of good architecture to executives.
2. Business acumen: An application architect should have a good understanding of the business goals and objectives, and be able to connect the work they do to the overall success of the company.
3. Leadership skills: An application architect should be able to lead and inspire others, and be able to effectively communicate their vision and persuade others to follow.
4. Data analysis skills: An application architect should be able to gather and analyze data to support their arguments and decisions, and be able to present this data in a clear and compelling way to executives.
5. Relationship-building skills: An application architect should be able to build strong relationships with executives and other key stakeholders, and be able to work collaboratively to achieve common goals.

## What are the best mechanisms to communicate application strategy and vision.

There are a few mechanisms that can be used to effectively communicate an application strategy and vision:

1. Presentations: Giving a presentation, either in person or through a video conference, can be a great way to communicate the strategy and vision to a group of executives or stakeholders.
2. Written documents: A well-written document, such as a white paper or a proposal, can be a useful way to communicate the strategy and vision in a more detailed and formal way.
3. Meetings: Holding regular meetings with key stakeholders can be an effective way to communicate the strategy and vision, and to get feedback and input from others.
4. Prototyping: Building a prototype of the application can be a powerful way to communicate the vision and demonstrate how the application will work in practice.
5. Visual aids: Using visual aids, such as diagrams, charts, or mockups, can help to clarify and illustrate the strategy and vision.

## If an architect does not have the resources or empowerment to build prototypes how else can they be effective.

If an application architect does not have the resources or empowerment to build prototypes, there are still a few ways they can be effective:

1. Use storytelling: An application architect can use storytelling to convey the vision and strategy in a way that is engaging and easy to understand. This could involve creating a narrative around the application, and describing how it will solve problems and meet the needs of users.
2. Use mockups or wireframes: If it's not possible to build a full prototype, creating mockups or wireframes of the application can be a good way to communicate the design and functionality.
3. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as diagrams, charts, or diagrams can help to clarify and illustrate the vision and strategy.
4. Work closely with stakeholders: An application architect can work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and goals, and to help them understand the vision and strategy. This can involve meeting with stakeholders regularly to discuss progress, and soliciting feedback and input.
5. Use existing resources: An application architect can use existing resources, such as existing applications or technologies, to demonstrate how the vision and strategy can be implemented. This can involve creating proof-of-concept prototypes or simulations.

## What are good application strategies for applications that are not connected to the internet.

Here are a few strategies that can be effective for applications that are not connected to the internet:

1. Design for offline functionality: It's important to consider how the application will function when it's not connected to the internet, and to design the application accordingly. This could involve implementing caching and synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the application can continue to function and access data while offline.
2. Use local storage: Local storage, such as a database or file system, can be used to store data and enable the application to function when it's offline.
3. Use peer-to-peer connectivity: If the application needs to communicate with other devices or systems, it may be possible to use peer-to-peer connectivity, such as Bluetooth or NFC, to enable communication without an internet connection.
4. Consider security: When designing an application that will be used without an internet connection, it's important to consider security and to ensure that data is protected against unauthorized access.
5. Test and optimize performance: It's important to thoroughly test the application to ensure that it performs well when used without an internet connection, and to optimize the application as needed to improve performance.

## What are modern intranet architectures for an enterprise to communicate with their employees.

There are a few modern intranet architectures that enterprises can use to communicate with their employees:

1. Cloud-based intranet: A cloud-based intranet is hosted on a cloud computing platform, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and can be accessed by employees over the internet. This architecture allows for easy scalability and maintenance, and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
2. Hybrid intranet: A hybrid intranet combines elements of both a cloud-based intranet and an on-premises intranet. This architecture can be useful for enterprises that have a mix of on-premises and cloud-based systems and want to integrate them into a single intranet.
3. Mobile intranet: A mobile intranet is designed to be accessed from mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and can be useful for enterprises with a mobile workforce.
4. Social intranet: A social intranet is designed to facilitate communication and collaboration among employees, and may include features such as forums, wikis, and blogs.
5. Single sign-on intranet: A single sign-on intranet allows employees to use a single set of login credentials to access multiple systems and applications. This can improve convenience and security.

## What vendors provide digital experience platforms.

There are many vendors that provide digital experience platforms, including:

1. Adobe Experience Platform
2. Acquia
3. Contentful
4. Episerver
5. Liferay
6. Magnolia
7. Sitecore
8. Salesforce Marketing Cloud
9. Oracle Marketing Cloud
10. Acquia CDP

These platforms provide a range of tools and capabilities for creating and managing digital experiences, such as content management, personalization, analytics, and customer data management. Some platforms are more comprehensive, while others focus on specific areas, such as content management or customer data management. It's important to carefully evaluate the features and capabilities of different platforms to determine which is the best fit for your specific needs and goals.
