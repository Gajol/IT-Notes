Web Site vs Application

A web-based application is a software application that is accessed over the internet through a web browser. It is a type of software that is designed to be run on a web server, rather than on a user's local computer. A web site, on the other hand, is a collection of web pages that are accessed through the internet and typically hosted on a web server.

A web site is usually made up of a collection of static pages that contain information about a particular topic or organization. It may contain text, images, videos, and other types of media, and is often used to provide information to visitors or to promote a product or service.

A web-based application, on the other hand, is a dynamic and interactive application that allows users to perform specific tasks or functions online. It may include features such as online forms, databases, and other interactive elements, and is often used for things like online banking, e-commerce, and other types of transactions.

So, the main difference between a web-based application and a web site is that a web-based application is a type of software that is designed to be run on a web server and allows users to perform specific tasks or functions online, while a web site is a collection of static web pages that provide information to visitors.
