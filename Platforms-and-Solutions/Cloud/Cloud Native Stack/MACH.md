[MACH Aliance](https://machalliance.org/)

- M: Micro-Services (Modular): Individual pieces of business functionality that are independently developed, deployed, and managed. A swappable architecture.
- A: API: All functionality is exposed through an API.
- C: Cloud: SaaS that leverages the cloud, beyond storage and hosting, including elastic scaling and automatically updating.
- H: Headless: Front-end presentation is decoupled from back-end logic and channel, programming language, and is framework agnostic.


Goal(https://machalliance.org/mach-technology):  
To ensure that enterprises can innovate swiftly and have an agile experience roadmap, they must own a modular “swappable” architecture. This is the only way to deploy new features rapidly and retain control of their destiny.

MACH Manifesto:
"Future proof enterprise technology and propel current and future digital experiences"


A MACH architecture—Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless—empowers retailers, and all companies for that matter, to deliver new features and experiences to customers faster. Members of the MACH Alliance are aligned on this architecture and understand it can give enterprises and retailers more freedom to mix and match products to further their strategic and tactical business goals.
