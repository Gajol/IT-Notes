#Terms:
- WCM : Web Content Management
- DXP : Digital Experience Platform
- Headless :  The "head" makes the web-pages (HTML, CSS, JS).  With headless CMS, the concept is the content is authored and stored in the backeng, and you can support multiple front-ends. [sanity.io Headless CMS in 2-minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uor3I0n_vQ)

# API
[PHP SDK for the Digital Collections DC-X Digital Asset Management system](https://github.com/digicol/dcx-sdk-php): The DcxApiClient class helps your custom PHP code connect to your DC-X system via the HTTP-based [DC-X JSON API](http://wiki.digicol.de/x/1oTc) (documented in our partner and customer Wiki).   [DC-X Stibo DAM](https://www.stibodx.com/solutions/digital-asset-management) (DX-X became Stibo)
- seems dated, and suggests to use latest [Guzzle version](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/).  Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client.

# Template Engine
TWIG: [TWIG in Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal) is a template engine for PHP and it is part of the [Symfony2 framework](http://symfony.com/).

# Front-End F/W - Bootstrap
[Bootstrap Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) This base theme bridges the gap between Drupal and the Bootstrap Framework.

# Options

## Follow GC.
- Drupal plus their authoring, accessibility, etc plugins (Bootstrap, Matomo, Wetkit, ...)
- reuse OGD development (plugins, governance, publishing, [wet kit](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-drupal), accessibility, ...)

### GC Standards - What is it?

### Drupal Based + React / Publishing
FE - React, BE - Drupal  (Decopuled Drupal)
- https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/decoupled-drupal-frontend-technologies

SSG + Drupal - Use Drupal as Headless CMS
- Drupal and Gatsby - [ref](https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/gatsby-decoupling-drupal)
  - Datasources : CMS (Contentful, Drupal, Wordpress, etc),
  - Markdown (Documentation, Posts, ..),
  - Data (API, Database, YAML, JSON, CSV, )
  - Building
  - -> GraphQL -> HTML, CSS, React
  - Deploy

- Drupal and Metalsmith - [ref](https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/metalsmith-drupal)

- Drupal, Gatsby, Next - [ref](https://colorfield.be/blog/drupal-gatsby-next-and-friends) - Not, TWIG, jQuery!
  - A way better DX: jQuery in 2021 is not so awesome when we have EcmaScript 6+ and TypeScript available for the whole frontend stack
  - Schema stitching is quite powerful when multiple sources are needed
  - React / Node stack is popular, so a larger developer base can join the project and team
  - Drupal might not even be needed for smaller projects: decoupled content services like Prismic, Contentful, Cosmic, Sanity, or   - Wordpress can perfectly fit. Some platforms are also providing their own CMS (e.g. Netlify)

  - When shall we use a Drupal backend (instead of any other decoupled CMS)?  The following non exhaustive cases could lead to the use of Drupal for the backend:

   - A rather complex content model
   - A requirement for workflows (content moderation) or    workspaces
   - Translation systems: Drupal 8 and 9 are coming with a mature translation system for content, locale, and configuration
   - The TMGMT module integrates with many translation providers (e.g. DeepL, Google or Supertext)
   - Media management: Drupal is powerful when it is about extending / exposing / searching internal or external media
   - When a high level of backend customization is needed
