# Intranet Features:
One could look at Drupal modules to see what are common features.  This list is a summary of ideas beyond the easy to comprehend features of a content management system ( publish content, search content, read content).

## Analytics
Analytics : Owners of web-sites are interested in how users find the information, how long they stay on the site, and whether they share information with others.   Some industry terms include; click-throughs, abandonment, social sharing and drop-off rates.

Their are entire SaaS companies and products that specialize in analytics for specific social media and web-site feeds (Google Analytics, Instagram/HopperHQ, ..).   It is not realistic to expect these abilities on-premise.   It is worthwhile understanding these features to see if there are business-value-streams we should consider.

|Feature|Industry Usage|Department Usage|
|--|--|--|
|Click-Through Rate (CTR)|Click-through rate (CTR) is a term used in digital marketing that refers to the percentage of people visiting a web page from an advertisement or organic search result.  The term comes from clicking-through the search results to the destination.  Calculation is #-clicks-from-add / #-times-add-displayed|None/Weak.  Direct Traffic from users typing in the URL directly, or opening a bookmark, or dark-social-channels (email URLs, instant-messaging-URLs, ...)|None [ref](https://directiveconsulting.com/resources/glossary/click-through-rate/).  We do not advertise our content through to other aggregators or search engines|
|
|Abandonment|Shapping Cart Based - Leaving Goods in the Cart|None|
|Social-Sharing||
|Drop-Off Rates|Identifies pages which are the last pages before users leave the web-site.  It can also on which page number (ordinal: first, second, ...) where the user left.|Limited: Potential future use if Intranet is more engaging|
|Reach|Unique individuals that come to the site, page, content.||
|Bounce Rate|The percentage of people that see/visit only one page during a site visit.|A measure of engagement and discoverabilty.  Ideally users visit more than one page as they are interested in the surrounding content.|


## Social Metrics:

|Feature|Industry Usage|Department Usage|
|--|--|--|
|Impression|Number of times your post appears on a users feed or timeline.  Scrolling through post (the preview) without clicking counts|Future: Ideally different web-sites (CMS, Altor, Intranet, ...) have feeds which can be security shared on other feeds|
|Growth Rate / Followers|What is the growth rate of followers?|None: 2017 concept of our Intranet was more dynamic with two-way employee engagement.   Two-way engagement may not be feasible with Intranet solution and requires future analysis and potentially a different platform ([FaceBook like platform? Mastodon](https://rigorousthemes.com/blog/best-open-source-facebook-alternatives/),  [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Disspora](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/): users make profiles, post images, content, ...)|

## Syndicate
The ability to subscribe to a feed.  The feed aay be availble in other applications (Outlook, Web Browser Bookmark, other web-site).  Popular feed formats are JSON, Atom 1.0 and RSS.
